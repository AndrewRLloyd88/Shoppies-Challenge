6	Apple Frangipan Tart	British	Preheat the oven to 200C/180C Fan/Gas 6. Put the biscuits in a large re-sealable freezer bag and bash with a rolling pin into fine crumbs. Melt the butter in a small pan, then add the biscuit crumbs and stir until coated with butter. Tip into the tart tin and, using the back of a spoon, press over the base and sides of the tin to give an even layer. Chill in the fridge while you make the filling. Cream together the butter and sugar until light and fluffy. You can do this in a food processor if you have one. Process for 2-3 minutes. Mix in the eggs, then add the ground almonds and almond extract and blend until well combined. Peel the apples, and cut thin slices of apple. Do this at the last minute to prevent the apple going brown. Arrange the slices over the biscuit base. Spread the frangipane filling evenly on top. Level the surface and sprinkle with the flaked almonds. Bake for 20-25 minutes until golden-brown and set. Remove from the oven and leave to cool for 15 minutes. Remove the sides of the tin. An easy way to do this is to stand the tin on a can of beans and push down gently on the edges of the tin. Transfer the tart, with the tin base attached, to a serving plate. Serve warm with cream, crème fraiche or ice cream.	https://www.themealdb.com/images/media/meals/wxywrq1468235067.jpg	Tart,Baking,Fruity	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rp8Slv4INLk	2020-10-27 21:11:28	2020-10-27 21:11:28	digestive biscuits	butter	Bramley apples	butter, softened	caster sugar	free-range eggs, beaten	ground almonds	almond extract	flaked almonds							null	null	null	null	null	175g/6oz	75g/3oz	200g/7oz	75g/3oz	75g/3oz	2	75g/3oz	1 tsp	50g/1¾oz							null	null	null	null	null
7	Apple & Blackberry Crumble	British	Heat oven to 190C/170C fan/gas 5. Tip the flour and sugar into a large bowl. Add the butter, then rub into the flour using your fingertips to make a light breadcrumb texture. Do not overwork it or the crumble will become heavy. Sprinkle the mixture evenly over a baking sheet and bake for 15 mins or until lightly coloured. Meanwhile, for the compote, peel, core and cut the apples into 2cm dice. Put the butter and sugar in a medium saucepan and melt together over a medium heat. Cook for 3 mins until the mixture turns to a light caramel. Stir in the apples and cook for 3 mins. Add the blackberries and cinnamon, and cook for 3 mins more. Cover, remove from the heat, then leave for 2-3 mins to continue cooking in the warmth of the pan. To serve, spoon the warm fruit into an ovenproof gratin dish, top with the crumble mix, then reheat in the oven for 5-10 mins. Serve with vanilla ice cream.	https://www.themealdb.com/images/media/meals/xvsurr1511719182.jpg	Pudding	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vhcOwVBDO4	2020-10-27 21:11:28	2020-10-27 21:11:28	Plain Flour	Caster Sugar	Butter	Braeburn Apples	Butter	Demerara Sugar	Blackberrys	Cinnamon	Ice Cream												120g	60g	60g	300g	30g	30g	120g	¼ teaspoon	to serve											
13	Beef Sunday Roast	British	Cook the Broccoli and Carrots in a pan of boiling water until tender. Roast the Beef and Potatoes in the oven for 45mins, the potatoes may need to be checked regularly to not overcook. To make the Yorkshire puddings: Heat oven to 230C/fan 210C/gas 8. Drizzle a little sunflower oil evenly into 2 x 4-hole Yorkshire pudding tins or a 12-hole non-stick muffin tin and place in the oven to heat through To make the batter, tip 140g plain flour into a bowl and beat in four eggs until smooth. Gradually add 200ml milk and carry on beating until the mix is completely lump-free. Season with salt and pepper. Pour the batter into a jug, then remove the hot tins from the oven. Carefully and evenly pour the batter into the holes. Place the tins back in the oven and leave undisturbed for 20-25 mins until the puddings have puffed up and browned. Serve immediately. Plate up and add the Gravy as desired.	https://www.themealdb.com/images/media/meals/ssrrrs1503664277.jpg	MainMeal	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2l3-dBdNehY	2020-10-27 21:11:28	2020-10-27 21:11:28	Beef	Broccoli	Potatoes	Carrots	plain flour	Eggs	milk	sunflower oil	null	null	null	null	null	null	null	null	null	null	null	null	8 slices	12 florets	1 Packet	1 Packet	140g	4	200ml	drizzle (for cooking)												
8	Bakewell tart	British	To make the pastry, measure the flour into a bowl and rub in the butter with your fingertips until the mixture resembles fine breadcrumbs. Add the water, mixing to form a soft dough. Roll out the dough on a lightly floured work surface and use to line a 20cm/8in flan tin. Leave in the fridge to chill for 30 minutes. Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6 (180C fan). Line the pastry case with foil and fill with baking beans. Bake blind for about 15 minutes, then remove the beans and foil and cook for a further five minutes to dry out the base. For the filing, spread the base of the flan generously with raspberry jam. Melt the butter in a pan, take off the heat and then stir in the sugar. Add ground almonds, egg and almond extract. Pour into the flan tin and sprinkle over the flaked almonds. Bake for about 35 minutes. If the almonds seem to be browning too quickly, cover the tart loosely with foil to prevent them burning.	https://www.themealdb.com/images/media/meals/wyrqqq1468233628.jpg	Tart,Baking,Alcoholic	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ahpSTf_Pvk	2020-10-27 21:11:28	2020-10-27 21:11:28	plain flour	chilled butter	cold water	raspberry jam	butter	caster sugar	ground almonds	free-range egg, beaten	almond extract	flaked almonds						null	null	null	null	null	175g/6oz	75g/2½oz	2-3 tbsp	1 tbsp	125g/4½oz	125g/4½oz	125g/4½oz	1	½ tsp	50g/1¾oz						null	null	null	null	null
9	Bread and Butter Pudding	British	Grease a 1 litre/2 pint pie dish with butter. Cut the crusts off the bread. Spread each slice with on one side with butter, then cut into triangles. Arrange a layer of bread, buttered-side up, in the bottom of the dish, then add a layer of sultanas. Sprinkle with a little cinnamon, then repeat the layers of bread and sultanas, sprinkling with cinnamon, until you have used up all of the bread. Finish with a layer of bread, then set aside. Gently warm the milk and cream in a pan over a low heat to scalding point. Don t let it boil. Crack the eggs into a bowl, add three quarters of the sugar and lightly whisk until pale. Add the warm milk and cream mixture and stir well, then strain the custard into a bowl. Pour the custard over the prepared bread layers and sprinkle with nutmeg and the remaining sugar and leave to stand for 30 minutes. Preheat the oven to 180C/355F/Gas 4. Place the dish into the oven and bake for 30-40 minutes, or until the custard has set and the top is golden-brown.	https://www.themealdb.com/images/media/meals/xqwwpy1483908697.jpg	Pudding,Brunch	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vz5W1-BmOE4	2020-10-27 21:11:28	2020-10-27 21:11:28	butter	bread	sultanas	cinnamon	milk	double cream	eggs	sugar	nutmeg												25g/1oz	8 thin slices	50g/2oz	2 tsp	350ml/12fl	50ml/2fl oz	2 free-range	25g/1oz	grated, to taste											
10	Beef Wellington	British	Put the mushrooms into a food processor with some seasoning and pulse to a rough paste. Scrape the paste into a pan and cook over a high heat for about 10 mins, tossing frequently, to cook out the moisture from the mushrooms. Spread out on a plate to cool. Heat in a frying pan and add a little olive oil. Season the beef and sear in the hot pan for 30 secs only on each side. (You don t want to cook it at this stage, just colour it). Remove the beef from the pan and leave to cool, then brush all over with the mustard. Lay a sheet of cling film on a work surface and arrange the Parma ham slices on it, in slightly overlapping rows. With a palette knife, spread the mushroom paste over the ham, then place the seared beef fillet in the middle. Keeping a tight hold of the cling film from the edge, neatly roll the Parma ham and mushrooms around the beef to form a tight barrel shape. Twist the ends of the cling film to secure. Chill for 15-20 mins to allow the beef to set and keep its shape. Roll out the puff pastry on a floured surface to a large rectangle, the thickness of a £1 coin. Remove the cling film from the beef, then lay in the centre. Brush the surrounding pastry with egg yolk. Fold the ends over, the wrap the pastry around the beef, cutting off any excess. Turn over, so the seam is underneath, and place on a baking sheet. Brush over all the pastry with egg and chill for about 15 mins to let the pastry rest. Heat the oven to 200C, 400F, gas 6. Lightly score the pastry at 1cm intervals and glaze again with beaten egg yolk. Bake for 20 minutes, then lower the oven setting to 180C, 350F, gas 4 and cook for another 15 mins. Allow to rest for 10-15 mins before slicing and serving with the side dishes of your choice. The beef should still be pink in the centre when you serve it.	https://www.themealdb.com/images/media/meals/vvpprx1487325699.jpg	Meat,Stew	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FS8u1RBdf6I	2020-10-27 21:11:28	2020-10-27 21:11:28	mushrooms	English Mustard	Olive Oil	Beef Fillet	Parma ham	Puff Pastry	Flour	Egg Yolks	null	null	null	null	null	null	null	null	null	null	null	null	400g	1-2tbsp	Dash	750g piece	6-8 slices	500g	Dusting	2 Beaten												
11	Baingan Bharta	Indian	Rinse the baingan (eggplant or aubergine) in water. Pat dry with a kitchen napkin. Apply some oil all over and keep it for roasting on an open flame. You can also grill the baingan or roast in the oven. But then you won t get the smoky flavor of the baingan. Keep the eggplant turning after a 2 to 3 minutes on the flame, so that its evenly cooked. You could also embed some garlic cloves in the baingan and then roast it. 2. Roast the aubergine till its completely cooked and tender. With a knife check the doneness. The knife should slid easily in aubergines without any resistance. Remove the baingan and immerse in a bowl of water till it cools down. 3. You can also do the dhungar technique of infusing charcoal smoky flavor in the baingan. This is an optional step. Use natural charcoal for this method. Heat a small piece of charcoal on flame till it becomes smoking hot and red. 4. Make small cuts on the baingan with a knife. Place the red hot charcoal in the same plate where the roasted aubergine is kept. Add a few drops of oil on the charcoal. The charcoal would begin to smoke. 5. As soon as smoke begins to release from the charcoal, cover the entire plate tightly with a large bowl. Allow the charcoal smoke to get infused for 1 to 2 minutes. The more you do, the more smoky the baingan bharta will become. I just keep for a minute. Alternatively, you can also do this dhungar method once the baingan bharta is cooked, just like the way we do for Dal Tadka. 6. Peel the skin from the roasted and smoked eggplant. 7. Chop the cooked eggplant finely or you can even mash it. 8. In a kadai or pan, heat oil. Then add finely chopped onions and garlic. 9. Saute the onions till translucent. Don t brown them. 10. Add chopped green chilies and saute for a minute. 11. Add the chopped tomatoes and mix it well. 12. Bhuno (saute) the tomatoes till the oil starts separating from the mixture. 13. Now add the red chili powder. Stir and mix well. 14. Add the chopped cooked baingan. 15. Stir and mix the chopped baingan very well with the onion­tomato masala mixture. 16. Season with salt. Stir and saute for some more 4 to 5 minutes more. 17. Finally stir in the coriander leaves with the baingan bharta or garnish it with them. Serve Baingan Bharta with phulkas, rotis or chapatis. It goes well even with bread, toasted or grilled bread and plain rice or jeera rice.	https://www.themealdb.com/images/media/meals/urtpqw1487341253.jpg	Spicy,Bun,Calorific	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-84Zz2EP4h4	2020-10-27 21:11:28	2020-10-27 21:11:28	Aubergine	Onion	Tomatoes	Garlic	Green Chili	Red Chili Powder	Oil	Coriander Leaves	salt												1 large	½ cup	1 cup	6 cloves	1	¼ teaspoon	1.5 tablespoon	1 tablespoon chopped	as required											
12	Beef Brisket Pot Roast	American	1 Prepare the brisket for cooking: On one side of the brisket there should be a layer of fat, which you want. If there are any large chunks of fat, cut them off and discard them. Large pieces of fat will not be able to render out completely. Using a sharp knife, score the fat in parallel lines, about 3/4-inch apart. Slice through the fat, not the beef. Repeat in the opposite direction to make a cross-hatch pattern. Salt the brisket well and let it sit at room temperature for 30 minutes. 2 Sear the brisket: You ll need an oven-proof, thick-bottomed pot with a cover, or Dutch oven, that is just wide enough to hold the brisket roast with a little room for the onions. Pat the brisket dry and place it, fatty side down, into the pot and place it on medium high heat. Cook for 5-8 minutes, lightly sizzling, until the fat side is nicely browned. (If the roast seems to be cooking too fast, turn the heat down to medium. You want a steady sizzle, not a raging sear.) Turn the brisket over and cook for a few minutes more to brown the other side. 3 Sauté the onions and garlic: When the brisket has browned, remove it from the pot and set aside. There should be a couple tablespoons of fat rendered in the pot, if not, add some olive oil. Add the chopped onions and increase the heat to high. Sprinkle a little salt on the onions. Sauté, stirring often, until the onions are lightly browned, 5-8 minutes. Stir in the garlic and cook 1-2 more minutes. 4 Return brisket to pot, add herbs, stock, bring to simmer, cover, cook in oven: Preheat the oven to 300°F. Use kitchen twine to tie together the bay leaves, rosemary and thyme. Move the onions and garlic to the sides of the pot and nestle the brisket inside. Add the beef stock and the tied-up herbs. Bring the stock to a boil on the stovetop. Cover the pot, place the pot in the 300°F oven and cook for 3 hours. Carefully flip the brisket every hour so it cooks evenly. 5 Add carrots, continue to cook: After 3 hours, add the carrots. Cover the pot and cook for 1 hour more, or until the carrots are cooked through and the brisket is falling-apart tender. 6 Remove brisket to cutting board, tent with foil: When the brisket is falling-apart tender, take the pot out of the oven and remove the brisket to a cutting board. Cover it with foil. Pull out and discard the herbs. 7 Make sauce (optional): At this point you have two options. You can serve as is, or you can make a sauce with the drippings and some of the onions. If you serve as is, skip this step. To make a sauce, remove the carrots and half of the onions, set aside and cover them with foil. Pour the ingredients that are remaining into the pot into a blender, and purée until smooth. If you want, add 1 tablespoon of mustard to the mix. Put into a small pot and keep warm. 8 Slice the meat across the grain: Notice the lines of the muscle fibers of the roast. This is the grain of the meat. Slice the meat perpendicular to these lines, or across the grain (cutting this way further tenderizes the meat), in 1/4-inch to 1/2-inch slices. Serve with the onions, carrots and gravy. Serve with mashed, roasted or boiled potatoes, egg noodles or polenta.	https://www.themealdb.com/images/media/meals/ursuup1487348423.jpg	Meat	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh48wM6bPWQ	2020-10-27 21:11:28	2020-10-27 21:11:28	Beef Brisket	Salt	Onion	Garlic	Thyme	Rosemary	Bay Leaves	beef stock	Carrots	Mustard	Potatoes	null	null	null	null	null	null	null	null	null	4-5 pound	Dash	3	5 cloves	1 Sprig	1 sprig	4	2 cups	3 Large	1 Tbsp	4 Mashed

Heat 2 tbsp olive oil in a large casserole and sear the meat on all sides until golden. Set to one side and add another small slug of oil to brown the chorizo. Remove and add the onion and garlic, spices, herbs and chillies then cook until soft in the chorizo oil. Season with salt and pepper and add the vinegar, tomatoes, ketchup and sugar. Put all the meat back into the pot with 400ml water (or red wine if you prefer), bring up to a simmer and cook, covered, in the low oven. After 2 hours, check the meat and add the beans. Cook for a further hour and just before serving, pull the meat apart with a pair of forks.	https://www.themealdb.com/images/media/meals/uuqvwu1504629254.jpg	null	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4kSoJgsu6Y	2020-10-27 21:11:28	2020-10-27 21:11:28	Beef	Onions	Garlic	Olive oil	Chorizo	Cumin	All spice	Cloves	Cinnamon stick	Bay Leaves	Oregano	Ancho Chillies	Balsamic Vinegar	Plum Tomatoes	Tomato Ketchup	Dark Brown Sugar	Borlotti Beans	null	null	null	1kg	3	4 cloves	Dash	300g	2 tsp	2 tsp	1 tsp	1 large	3	2 tsp dried	2 ancho	3 tbsp	2 x 400g	2 tbsp	2 tbsp	2 x 400g tins			
15	Beef stroganoff	Russian	Heat the olive oil in a non-stick frying pan then add the sliced onion and cook on a medium heat until completely softened, so around 15 mins, adding a little splash of water if they start to stick at all. Crush in the garlic and cook for a 2-3 mins further, then add the butter. Once the butter is foaming a little, add the mushrooms and cook for around 5 mins until completely softened. Season everything well, then tip onto a plate. Tip the flour into a bowl with a big pinch of salt and pepper, then toss the steak in the seasoned flour. Add the steak pieces to the pan, splashing in a little oil if the pan looks particularly dry, and fry for 3-4 mins, until well coloured. Tip the onions and mushrooms back into the pan. Whisk the crème fraîche, mustard and beef stock together, then pour into the pan. Cook over a medium heat for around 5 mins.

19	Beef Dumpling Stew	British	Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4. For the beef stew, heat the oil and butter in an ovenproof casserole and fry the beef until browned on all sides. Sprinkle over the flour and cook for a further 2-3 minutes. Add the garlic and all the vegetables and fry for 1-2 minutes. Stir in the wine, stock and herbs, then add the Worcestershire sauce and balsamic vinegar, to taste. Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Cover with a lid, transfer to the oven and cook for about two hours, or until the meat is tender. For the dumplings, sift the flour, baking powder and salt into a bowl. Add the suet and enough water to form a thick dough. With floured hands, roll spoonfuls of the dough into small balls. After two hours, remove the lid from the stew and place the balls on top of the stew. Cover, return to the oven and cook for a further 20 minutes, or until the dumplings have swollen and are tender. (If you prefer your dumplings with a golden top, leave the lid off when returning to the oven.) To serve, place a spoonful of mashed potato onto each of four serving plates and top with the stew and dumplings. Sprinkle with chopped parsley.	https://www.themealdb.com/images/media/meals/uyqrrv1511553350.jpg	Stew,Baking	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NgheY-r5t0	2020-10-27 21:11:28	2020-10-27 21:11:28	Olive Oil	Butter	Beef	Plain Flour	Garlic	Onions	Celery	Carrots	Leek	Swede	Red Wine	Beef Stock	Bay Leaf	Thyme	Parsley	Plain Flour	Baking Powder	Suet	Water	null	2 tbs	25g	750g	2 tblsp	2 cloves minced	175g	150g	150g	2 chopped	200g	150ml	500g	2	3 tbs	3 tblsp chopped	125g	1 tsp	60g	Splash	
27	BeaverTails	Canadian	In the bowl of a stand mixer, add warm water, a big pinch of sugar and yeast. Allow to sit until frothy. Into the same bowl, add 1/2 cup sugar, warm milk, melted butter, eggs and salt, and whisk until combined. Place a dough hook on the mixer, add the flour with the machine on, until a smooth but slightly sticky dough forms. Place dough in a bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and allow to proof for 1 1/2 hours. Cut dough into 12 pieces, and roll out into long oval-like shapes about 1/4 inch thick that resemble a beaver’s tail. In a large, deep pot, heat oil to 350 degrees. Gently place beavertail dough into hot oil and cook for 30 to 45 seconds on each side until golden brown. Drain on paper towels, and garnish as desired. Toss in cinnamon sugar, in white sugar with a squeeze of lemon, or with a generous slathering of Nutella and a handful of toasted almonds.

20	Beef and Mustard Pie	British	Preheat the oven to 150C/300F/Gas 2. Toss the beef and flour together in a bowl with some salt and black pepper. Heat a large casserole until hot, add half of the rapeseed oil and enough of the beef to just cover the bottom of the casserole. Fry until browned on each side, then remove and set aside. Repeat with the remaining oil and beef. Return the beef to the pan, add the wine and cook until the volume of liquid has reduced by half, then add the stock, onion, carrots, thyme and mustard, and season well with salt and pepper. Cover with a lid and place in the oven for two hours. Remove from the oven, check the seasoning and set aside to cool. Remove the thyme. When the beef is cool and you re ready to assemble the pie, preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6. Transfer the beef to a pie dish, brush the rim with the beaten egg yolks and lay the pastry over the top. Brush the top of the pastry with more beaten egg. Trim the pastry so there is just enough excess to crimp the edges, then place in the oven and bake for 30 minutes, or until the pastry is golden-brown and cooked through. For the green beans, bring a saucepan of salted water to the boil, add the beans and cook for 4-5 minutes, or until just tender. Drain and toss with the butter, then season with black pepper. To serve, place a large spoonful of pie onto each plate with some green beans alongside.	https://www.themealdb.com/images/media/meals/sytuqu1511553755.jpg	Meat,Pie	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMyBC9staMU	2020-10-27 21:11:28	2020-10-27 21:11:28	Beef	Plain Flour	Rapeseed Oil	Red Wine	Beef Stock	Onion	Carrots	Thyme	Mustard	Egg Yolks	Puff Pastry	Green Beans	Butter	Salt	Pepper						1kg	2 tbs	2 tbs	200ml	400ml	1 finely sliced	2 chopped	3 sprigs	2 tbs	2 free-range	400g	300g	25g	pinch	pinch					
21	Beef and Oyster pie	British	Season the beef cubes with salt and black pepper. Heat a tablespoon of oil in the frying pan and fry the meat over a high heat. Do this in three batches so that you don’t overcrowd the pan, transferring the meat to a large flameproof casserole dish once it is browned all over. Add extra oil if the pan seems dry. In the same pan, add another tablespoon of oil and cook the shallots for 4-5 minutes, then add the garlic and fry for 30 seconds. Add the bacon and fry until slightly browned. Transfer the onion and bacon mixture to the casserole dish and add the herbs. Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4. Pour the stout into the frying pan and bring to the boil, stirring to lift any stuck-on browned bits from the bottom of the pan. Pour the stout over the beef in the casserole dish and add the stock. Cover the casserole and place it in the oven for 1½-2 hours, or until the beef is tender and the sauce is reduced. Skim off any surface fat, taste and add salt and pepper if necessary, then stir in the cornflour paste. Put the casserole dish on the hob – don’t forget that it will be hot – and simmer for 1-2 minutes, stirring, until thickened. Leave to cool. Increase the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6. To make the pastry, put the flour and salt in a very large bowl. Grate the butter and stir it into the flour in three batches. Gradually add 325ml/11fl oz cold water – you may not need it all – and stir with a round-bladed knife until the mixture just comes together. Knead the pastry lightly into a ball on a lightly floured surface and set aside 250g/9oz for the pie lid. Roll the rest of the pastry out until about 2cm/¾in larger than the dish you’re using. Line the dish with the pastry then pile in the filling, tucking the oysters in as well. Brush the edge of the pastry with beaten egg. Roll the remaining pastry until slightly larger than your dish and gently lift over the filling, pressing the edges firmly to seal, then trim with a sharp knife. Brush with beaten egg to glaze. Put the dish on a baking tray and bake for 25-30 minutes, or until the pastry is golden-brown and the filling is bubbling.	https://www.themealdb.com/images/media/meals/wrssvt1511556563.jpg	Pie	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONX74yP6JnI	2020-10-27 21:11:28	2020-10-27 21:11:28	Beef	Olive Oil	Shallots	Garlic	Bacon	Thyme	Bay Leaf	Stout	Beef Stock	Corn Flour	Oysters	Plain Flour	Salt	Butter	Eggs						900g	3 tbs	3	2 cloves minced	125g	1 tbs chopped	2	330ml	400ml	2 tbs	8	400g	pinch	250g	To Glaze					
22	Blackberry Fool	British	For the biscuits, preheat the oven to 200C/180C (fan)/Gas 6 and line two large baking trays with baking parchment. Scatter the nuts over a baking tray and roast in the oven for 6-8 minutes, or until golden-brown. Watch them carefully so that they don’t have a chance to burn. Remove from the oven, tip onto a board and leave to cool. Put the butter and sugar in a large bowl and beat with a wooden spoon until light and creamy. Roughly chop the cooled nuts and add to the creamed butter and sugar, along with the lemon zest, flour and baking powder. Stir well until the mixture comes together and forms a ball – you may need to use your hands. Divide the biscuit dough into 24 even pieces and roll into small balls. Place the balls the prepared baking trays, spaced well apart to allow for spreading. Press the biscuits to flatten to around 1cm/½in thick. Bake the biscuits, one tray at a time, for 12 minutes or until very pale golden-brown. Leave to cool on the trays. They will be very soft when you take them out of the oven, but will crisp as they cool. Store in an airtight tin and eat within five days. For the fool, rinse the blackberries in a colander to wash away any dust or dirt. Put the blackberries in a non-stick saucepan and sprinkle over the caster sugar. Stir in the lemon juice and heat gently for two minutes, or until the blackberries begin to soften and release their juices. Remove and reserve 12 blackberries for decoration and continue cooking the rest. Simmer the blackberries very gently for 15 minutes, stirring regularly until very soft and squidgy. Remove from the heat and press the berries and juice through a sieve over a bowl, using the bottom of a ladle to help you extract as much of the purée as possible. Leave the purée to cool and discard the seeds. You should end up with around 325ml/11fl oz of purée. Put the cream and yoghurt in a large bowl and whip with an electric whisk until soft peaks form when the whisk is removed from the bowl – the acidity of the fruit will thicken the cream further, so don’t take it too far. When the purée is completely cold, adjust the sweetness to taste by adding more sugar if needed. Pour it into the bowl with the whipped cream and yoghurt and stir just once or twice until very lightly combined. Spoon the blackberry fool into individual wide, glass dishes – or one large, single bowl. It should look quite marbled, so don’t over-stir it. Scatter a few tiny mint leaves on top and decorate with the reserved blackberries. Sprinkle with a little sugar if you like and serve with the hazelnut biscuits.	https://www.themealdb.com/images/media/meals/rpvptu1511641092.jpg	Desert,Summer,Fruity,Dairy	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kniRGjDLFrQ	2020-10-27 21:11:28	2020-10-27 21:11:28	Hazlenuts	Butter	Caster Sugar	Lemon	Plain Flour	Baking Powder	Blackberrys	Sugar	Caster Sugar	Lemon Juice	Double Cream	Yogurt	Mint								50g	125g	150g	Grated	150g	½ tsp	600g	75g	2 tbs	1 tbs	300ml	100ml	Garnish with							
23	Battenberg Cake	British	Heat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4 and line the base and sides of a 20cm square tin with baking parchment (the easiest way is to cross 2 x 20cm-long strips over the base). To make the almond sponge, put the butter, sugar, flour, ground almonds, baking powder, eggs, vanilla and almond extract in a large bowl. Beat with an electric whisk until the mix comes together smoothly. Scrape into the tin, spreading to the corners, and bake for 25-30 mins – when you poke in a skewer, it should come out clean. Cool in the tin for 10 mins, then transfer to a wire rack to finish cooling while you make the second sponge. For the pink sponge, line the tin as above. Mix all the ingredients together as above, but don’t add the almond extract. Fold in some pink food colouring. Then scrape it all into the tin and bake as before. Cool. To assemble, heat the jam in a small pan until runny, then sieve. Barely trim two opposite edges from the almond sponge, then well trim a third edge. Roughly measure the height of the sponge, then cutting from the well-trimmed edge, use a ruler to help you cut 4 slices each the same width as the sponge height. Discard or nibble leftover sponge. Repeat with pink cake. Take 2 x almond slices and 2 x pink slices and trim so they are all the same length. Roll out one marzipan block on a surface lightly dusted with icing sugar to just over 20cm wide, then keep rolling lengthways until the marzipan is roughly 0.5cm thick. Brush with apricot jam, then lay a pink and an almond slice side by side at one end of the marzipan, brushing jam in between to stick sponges, and leaving 4cm clear marzipan at the end. Brush more jam on top of the sponges, then sandwich remaining 2 slices on top, alternating colours to give a checkerboard effect. Trim the marzipan to the length of the cakes. Carefully lift up the marzipan and smooth over the cake with your hands, but leave a small marzipan fold along the bottom edge before you stick it to the first side. Trim opposite side to match size of fold, then crimp edges using fingers and thumb (or, more simply, press with prongs of fork). If you like, mark the 10 slices using the prongs of a fork.

24	Beef Bourguignon	French	Heat a large casserole pan and add 1 tbsp goose fat. Season the beef and fry until golden brown, about 3-5 mins, then turn over and fry the other side until the meat is browned all over, adding more fat if necessary. Do this in 2-3 batches, transferring the meat to a colander set over a bowl when browned. In the same pan, fry the bacon, shallots or pearl onions, mushrooms, garlic and bouquet garni until lightly browned. Mix in the tomato purée and cook for a few mins, stirring into the mixture. This enriches the bourguignon and makes a great base for the stew. Then return the beef and any drained juices to the pan and stir through. Pour over the wine and about 100ml water so the meat bobs up from the liquid, but isn’t completely covered. Bring to the boil and use a spoon to scrape the caramelised cooking juices from the bottom of the pan – this will give the stew more flavour. Heat oven to 150C/fan 130C/gas 2. Make a cartouche: tear off a square of foil slightly larger than the casserole, arrange it in the pan so it covers the top of the stew and trim away any excess foil. Then cook for 3 hrs. If the sauce looks watery, remove the beef and veg with a slotted spoon, and set aside. Cook the sauce over a high heat for a few mins until the sauce has thickened a little, then return the beef and vegetables to the pan. To make the celeriac mash, peel the celeriac and cut into cubes. Heat the olive oil in a large frying pan. Tip in the celeriac and fry for 5 mins until it turns golden. Season well with salt and pepper. Stir in the rosemary, thyme, bay and cardamom pods, then pour over 200ml water, enough to nearly cover the celeriac. Turn the heat to low, partially cover the pan and leave to simmer for 25-30 mins. After 25-30 mins, the celeriac should be soft and most of the water will have evaporated. Drain away any remaining water, then remove the herb sprigs, bay and cardamom pods. Lightly crush with a potato masher, then finish with a glug of olive oil and season to taste. Spoon the beef bourguignon into serving bowls and place a large spoonful of the celeriac mash on top. Garnish with one of the bay leaves, if you like.	https://www.themealdb.com/images/media/meals/vtqxtu1511784197.jpg	null	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQnr4Z-7rok	2020-10-27 21:11:28	2020-10-27 21:11:28	Goose Fat	Beef Shin	Bacon	Challots	Chestnut Mushroom	Garlic Clove	Bouquet Garni	Tomato Puree	Red Wine	Celeriac	Olive Oil	Thyme	Rosemary	Bay Leaf	Cardamom						3 tsp	600g	100g	350g	250g	2 sliced	1	1 tbs	750 ml	600g	2 tbs	sprigs of fresh	sprigs of fresh	2	4

32	Breakfast Potatoes	Canadian	Before you do anything, freeze your bacon slices that way when you re ready to prep, it ll be so much easier to chop! Wash the potatoes and cut medium dice into square pieces. To prevent any browning, place the already cut potatoes in a bowl filled with water. In the meantime, heat 1-2 tablespoons of oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Tilt the skillet so the oil spreads evenly. Once the oil is hot, drain the potatoes and add to the skillet. Season with salt, pepper, and Old Bay as needed. Cook for 10 minutes, stirring the potatoes often, until brown. If needed, add a tablespoon more of oil. Chop up the bacon and add to the potatoes. The bacon will start to render and the fat will begin to further cook the potatoes. Toss it up a bit! The bacon will take 5-6 minutes to crisp. Once the bacon is cooked, reduce the heat to medium-low, add the minced garlic and toss. Season once more. Add dried or fresh parsley. Control heat as needed. Let the garlic cook until fragrant, about one minute. Just before serving, drizzle over the maple syrup and toss. Let that cook another minute, giving the potatoes a caramelized effect. Serve in a warm bowl with a sunny side up egg!	https://www.themealdb.com/images/media/meals/1550441882.jpg	Breakfast,Brunch,	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoD0TIO9nE4	2020-10-27 21:11:28	2020-10-27 21:11:28	Potatoes	Olive Oil	Bacon	Garlic Clove	Maple Syrup	Parsley	Salt	Pepper	Allspice												3 Medium	1 tbs	2 strips	Minced	1 tbs	Garnish	Pinch	Pinch	To taste											
33	Bitterballen (Dutch meatballs)	Dutch	Melt the butter in a skillet or pan. When melted, add the flour little by little and stir into a thick paste. Slowly stir in the stock, making sure the roux absorbs the liquid. Simmer for a couple of minutes on a low heat while you stir in the onion, parsley and the shredded meat. The mixture should thicken and turn into a heavy, thick sauce. Pour the mixture into a shallow container, cover and refrigerate for several hours, or until the sauce has solidified. Take a heaping tablespoon of the cold, thick sauce and quickly roll it into a small ball. Roll lightly through the flour, then the egg and finally the breadcrumbs. Make sure that the egg covers the whole surface of the bitterbal. When done, refrigerate the snacks while the oil in your fryer heats up to 190C (375F). Fry four bitterballen at a time, until golden. Serve on a plate with a nice grainy or spicy mustard.	https://www.themealdb.com/images/media/meals/lhqev81565090111.jpg	DinnerParty,HangoverFood,Alcoholic	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8AKfYUtDuM	2020-10-27 21:11:28	2020-10-27 21:11:28	Butter	Flour	Beef Stock	Onion	Parsley	Beef	Salt	Pepper	Nutmeg	Flour	Eggs	Breadcrumbs									100g	150g	700ml	30g	1 tbs	400g	Pinch	Pinch	Pinch	50g	2 Beaten	50g

39	Chicken Enchilada Casserole	Mexican	Cut each chicken breast in about 3 pieces, so that it cooks faster and put it in a small pot. Pour Enchilada sauce over it and cook covered on low to medium heat until chicken is cooked through, about 20 minutes. No water is needed, the chicken will cook in the Enchilada sauce. Make sure you stir occasionally so that it doesn t stick to the bottom. Remove chicken from the pot and shred with two forks. Preheat oven to 375 F degrees. Start layering the casserole. Start with about ¼ cup of the leftover Enchilada sauce over the bottom of a baking dish. I used a longer baking dish, so that I can put 2 corn tortillas across. Place 2 tortillas on the bottom, top with ⅓ of the chicken and ⅓ of the remaining sauce. Sprinkle with ⅓ of the cheese and repeat starting with 2 more tortillas, then chicken, sauce, cheese. Repeat with last layer with the remaining ingredients, tortillas, chicken, sauce and cheese. Bake for 20 to 30 minutes uncovered, until bubbly and cheese has melted and started to brown on top.

Melt the butter, sugar, syrup and orange zest in a large saucepan over a medium heat. The aim is to dissolve all the ingredients so that they are smooth, but to not lose any volume through boiling so be careful not to overheat. Add the oats and stir well until evenly coated. Stir through the leftover Christmas pudding and tip into the prepared tin. Use a spoon to flatten the top and bake for 40 minutes until the edges start to brown. Whilst still warm in the tin, score into 12 squares. Allow to cool completely before cutting along the scores.

42	Chicken Handi	Indian	Take a large pot or wok, big enough to cook all the chicken, and heat the oil in it. Once the oil is hot, add sliced onion and fry them until deep golden brown. Then take them out on a plate and set aside. To the same pot, add the chopped garlic and sauté for a minute. Then add the chopped tomatoes and cook until tomatoes turn soft. This would take about 5 minutes. Then return the fried onion to the pot and stir. Add ginger paste and sauté well. Now add the cumin seeds, half of the coriander seeds and chopped green chillies. Give them a quick stir. Next goes in the spices – turmeric powder and red chilli powder. Sauté the spices well for couple of minutes. Add the chicken pieces to the wok, season it with salt to taste and cook the chicken covered on medium-low heat until the chicken is almost cooked through. This would take about 15 minutes. Slowly sautéing the chicken will enhance the flavor, so do not expedite this step by putting it on high heat. When the oil separates from the spices, add the beaten yogurt keeping the heat on lowest so that the yogurt doesn’t split. Sprinkle the remaining coriander seeds and add half of the dried fenugreek leaves. Mix well. Finally add the cream and give a final mix to combine everything well.

54	Chocolate Avocado Mousse	British	1. Blend all the mousse ingredients together in your food processor until smooth. Add the cacao powder first and, as you blend, have all the ingredients to hand in order to adjust the ratios slightly as the size of avocados and bananas varies so much. The perfect ratio in order to avoid the dish tasting too much of either is to use equal amounts of both. 2. Taste and add a few drops of stevia if you feel you need more sweetness. 3. Fill little cups or shot glasses with the mousse, sprinkle with the cacao powder or nibs and serve. Tip If you don’t have a frozen banana to hand you can just use a normal one and then chill the mousse before serving for a cooling dessert.	https://www.themealdb.com/images/media/meals/uttuxy1511382180.jpg	null	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wuZffe60q4M	2020-10-27 21:11:28	2020-10-27 21:11:28	Banana	Cacao	Avocado	Honey	Lemon Juice	Vanilla	Water	Sea Salt													1	3 tbsp	1	2 tblsp	1 tsp	1 tsp	2 tbsp	pinch												
43	Chicken Alfredo Primavera	Italian	Heat 1 tablespoon of butter and 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Season both sides of each chicken breast with seasoned salt and a pinch of pepper. Add the chicken to the skillet and cook for 5-7 minutes on each side, or until cooked through. While the chicken is cooking, bring a large pot of water to a boil. Season the boiling water with a few generous pinches of kosher salt. Add the pasta and give it a stir. Cook, stirring occasionally, until al dente, about 12 minutes. Reserve 1/2 cup of pasta water before draining the pasta. Remove the chicken from the pan and transfer it to a cutting board; allow it to rest. Turn the heat down to medium and dd the remaining 1 tablespoon of butter and olive oil to the same pan you used to cook the chicken. Add the veggies (minus the garlic) and red pepper flakes to the pan and stir to coat with the oil and butter (refrain from seasoning with salt until the veggies are finished browning). Cook, stirring often, until the veggies are tender, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and a generous pinch of salt and pepper to the pan and cook for 1 minute. Deglaze the pan with the white wine. Continue to cook until the wine has reduced by half, about 3 minutes. Stir in the milk, heavy cream, and reserved pasta water. Bring the mixture to a gentle boil and allow to simmer and reduce for 2-3 minutes. Turn off the heat and add the Parmesan cheese and cooked pasta. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Garnish with Parmesan cheese and chopped parsley, if desired.	https://www.themealdb.com/images/media/meals/syqypv1486981727.jpg	Pasta,Meat,Dairy	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCIbq8HywpQ	2020-10-27 21:11:28	2020-10-27 21:11:28	Butter	Olive Oil	Chicken	Salt	Squash	Broccoli	mushrooms	Pepper	onion	garlic	red pepper flakes	white wine	milk	heavy cream	Parmesan cheese	bowtie pasta	Salt	Pepper	Parsley		2 tablespoons	3 tablespoons	5 boneless	1 teaspoon	1 cut into 1/2-inch cubes	1 Head chopped	8-ounce sliced	1 red	1 chopped	3 cloves	1/2 teaspoon	1/2 cup	1/2 cup	1/2 cup	1 cup grated	16 ounces	pinch	pinch	chopped

45	Cajun spiced fish tacos	Mexican	Cooking in a cajun spice and cayenne pepper marinade makes this fish super succulent and flavoursome. Top with a zesty dressing and serve in a tortilla for a quick, fuss-free main that s delightfully summery. On a large plate, mix the cajun spice and cayenne pepper with a little seasoning and use to coat the fish all over. Heat a little oil in a frying pan, add in the fish and cook over a medium heat until golden. Reduce the heat and continue frying until the fish is cooked through, about 10 minutes. Cook in batches if you don’t have enough room in the pan. Meanwhile, prepare the dressing by combining all the ingredients with a little seasoning. Soften the tortillas by heating in the microwave for 5-10 seconds. Pile high with the avocado, lettuce and spring onion, add a spoonful of salsa, top with large flakes of fish and drizzle over the dressing.	https://www.themealdb.com/images/media/meals/uvuyxu1503067369.jpg	Spicy,Fish	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4EdUt0Ou48	2020-10-27 21:11:28	2020-10-27 21:11:28	cajun	cayenne pepper	white fish	vegetable oil	flour tortilla	avocado	little gem lettuce	spring onion	salsa	sour cream	lemon	garlic									2 tbsp	1 tsp	4 fillets	1 tsp	8	1 sliced	2 shredded	4 shredded	1 x 300ml	1 pot	1	1 clove finely chopped								
46	Crock Pot Chicken Baked Tacos	Mexican	Put the uncooked chicken breasts in the crock pot. Pour the full bottle of salad dressing over the chicken. Sprinkle the rest of the ingredients over the top and mix them in a bit with a spoon. Cover your crock pot with the lid and cook on high for 4 hours. Remove all the chicken breasts from the crock pot and let cool. Shred the chicken breasts and move to a glass bowl. Pour most of the liquid over the shredded chicken. FOR THE TACOS: Make the guacamole sauce by mixing the avocado and green salsa together. Pour the guacamole mixture through a strainer until smooth and transfer to a squeeze bottle. Cut the tip off the lid of the squeeze bottle to make the opening more wide if needed. Make the sour cream sauce by mixing the sour cream and milk together until you get a more liquid sour cream sauce. Transfer to a squeeze bottle. In a 9x 13 glass baking dish, fill all 12+ tacos with a layer of refried beans, cooked chicken and shredded cheese. Bake at 450 for 10-15 minutes just until the cheese is melted and bubbling. Out of the oven top all the tacos with the sliced grape tomaotes, jalapeno and cilantro. Finish with a drizzle of guacamole and sour cream.

47	Chicken Karaage	Japanese	Add the ginger, garlic, soy sauce, sake and sugar to a bowl and whisk to combine. Add the chicken, then stir to coat evenly. Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour. Add 1 inch of vegetable oil to a heavy bottomed pot and heat until the oil reaches 360 degrees F. Line a wire rack with 2 sheets of paper towels and get your tongs out. Put the potato starch in a bowl Add a handful of chicken to the potato starch and toss to coat each piece evenly. Fry the karaage in batches until the exterior is a medium brown and the chicken is cooked through. Transfer the fried chicken to the paper towel lined rack. If you want the karaage to stay crispy longer, you can fry the chicken a second time, until it s a darker color after it s cooled off once. Serve with lemon wedges.	https://www.themealdb.com/images/media/meals/tyywsw1505930373.jpg	null	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XivddFddthc	2020-10-27 21:11:28	2020-10-27 21:11:28	Chicken thigh	Ginger	Garlic	Soy sauce	Sake	Granulated sugar	Potato starch	Vegetable oil	Lemon												450 grams Boneless skin	1 tablespoon	1 clove	2 tablespoons	1 tablespoon	2 teaspoon	1/3 cup	1/3 cup	1/3 cup											
60	Carrot Cake	British	For the carrot cake, preheat the oven to 160C/325F/Gas 3. Grease and line a 26cm/10in springform cake tin. Mix all of the ingredients for the carrot cake, except the carrots and walnuts, together in a bowl until well combined. Stir in the carrots and walnuts. Spoon the mixture into the cake tin and bake for 1 hour 15 minutes, or until a skewer inserted into the middle comes out clean. Remove the cake from the oven and set aside to cool for 10 minutes, then carefully remove the cake from the tin and set aside to cool completely on a cooling rack. Meanwhile, for the icing, beat the cream cheese, caster sugar and butter together in a bowl until fluffy. Spread the icing over the top of the cake with a palette knife.	https://www.themealdb.com/images/media/meals/vrspxv1511722107.jpg	Cake,Treat,Sweet	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asjZ7iTrGKA	2020-10-27 21:11:28	2020-10-27 21:11:28	Vegetable Oil	Plain Flour	Bicarbonate Of Soda	Sugar	Eggs	Salt	Cinnamon	Carrots	Walnuts	Cream Cheese	Caster Sugar	Butter									450ml	400g	2 tsp	550ml	5	½ tsp	2 tsp	500g grated	150g	200g	150g	100g								
48	Coq au vin	French	Heat 1 tbsp of the oil in a large, heavy-based saucepan or flameproof dish. Tip in the bacon and fry until crisp. Remove and drain on kitchen paper. Add the shallots to the pan and fry, stirring or shaking the pan often, for 5-8 mins until well browned all over. Remove and set aside with the bacon. Pat the chicken pieces dry with kitchen paper. Pour the remaining oil into the pan, then fry half the chicken pieces, turning regularly, for 5-8 mins until well browned. Remove, then repeat with the remaining chicken. Remove and set aside. Scatter in the garlic and fry briefly, then, with the heat medium-high, pour in the brandy or Cognac, stirring the bottom of the pan to deglaze. The alcohol should sizzle and start to evaporate so there is not much left. Return the chicken legs and thighs to the pan along with any juices, then pour in a little of the wine, stirring the bottom of the pan again. Stir in the rest of the wine, the stock and tomato purée, drop in the bouquet garni, season with pepper and a pinch of salt, then return the bacon and shallots to the pan. Cover, lower the heat to a gentle simmer, add the chicken breasts and cook for 50 mins-1hr. Just before ready to serve, heat the oil for the mushrooms in a large non-stick frying pan. Add the mushrooms and fry over a high heat for a few mins until golden. Remove and keep warm. Lift the chicken, shallots and bacon from the pan and transfer to a warmed serving dish. Remove the bouquet garni. To make the thickener, mix the flour, olive oil and butter in a small bowl using the back of a teaspoon. Bring the wine mixture to a gentle boil, then gradually drop in small pieces of the thickener, whisking each piece in using a wire whisk. Simmer for 1-2 mins. Scatter the mushrooms over the chicken, then pour over the wine sauce. Garnish with chopped parsley.	https://www.themealdb.com/images/media/meals/qstyvs1505931190.jpg	null	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ise46LADBs	2020-10-27 21:11:28	2020-10-27 21:11:28	Olive Oil	Bacon	Shallots	Chicken Legs	Chicken Thighs	Chicken Breasts	Garlic	Brandy	Red Wine	Chicken Stock	tomato puree	thyme	Rosemary	bay leaves	parsley	chestnut mushroom	plain flour	butter			1½ tbsp	3 rashers (100g) chopped dry-cured	12 small	2 (460g)	4 (650g)	2 (280g)	3 finely chopped	3 tbsp	600ml	150ml	2 tsp	3 sprigs	2 sprigs	2	garnish	250g	2 tbsp	1 tsp		
49	Chilli prawn linguine	Italian	Mix the dressing ingredients in a small bowl and season with salt and pepper. Set aside. Cook the pasta according to the packet instructions. Add the sugar snap peas for the last minute or so of cooking time. Meanwhile, heat the oil in a wok or large frying pan, toss in the garlic and chilli and cook over a fairly gentle heat for about 30 seconds without letting the garlic brown. Tip in the prawns and cook over a high heat, stirring frequently, for about 3 minutes until they turn pink. Add the tomatoes and cook, stirring occasionally, for 3 minutes until they just start to soften. Drain the pasta and sugar snaps well, then toss into the prawn mixture. Tear in the basil leaves, stir, and season with salt and pepper. Serve with salad leaves drizzled with the lime dressing, and warm crusty bread.	https://www.themealdb.com/images/media/meals/usywpp1511189717.jpg	null	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SC17Mc70Db0	2020-10-27 21:11:28	2020-10-27 21:11:28	Linguine Pasta	Sugar Snap Peas	Olive Oil	Garlic Clove	Red Chilli	King Prawns	Cherry Tomatoes	Basil Leaves	Lettuce	Bread	Fromage Frais	Lime	Caster Sugar								280g	200g	2 tblsp	2 cloves chopped	1 large	24 Skinned	12	Handful	Leaves	to serve	2 tbsp	Grated Zest of 2	2 tsp							
50	Clam chowder	American	Rinse the clams in several changes of cold water and drain well. Tip the clams into a large pan with 500ml of water. Cover, bring to the boil and simmer for 2 mins until the clams have just opened. Tip the contents of the pan into a colander over a bowl to catch the clam stock. When cool enough to handle, remove the clams from their shells – reserving a handful of empty shells for presentation if you want. Strain the clam stock into a jug, leaving any grit in the bottom of the bowl. You should have around 800ml stock. Heat the butter in the same pan and sizzle the bacon for 3-4 mins until it starts to brown. Stir in the onion, thyme and bay and cook everything gently for 10 mins until the onion is soft and golden. Scatter over the flour and stir in to make a sandy paste, cook for 2 mins more, then gradually stir in the clam stock then the milk and the cream. Throw in the potatoes, bring everything to a simmer and leave to bubble away gently for 10 mins or until the potatoes are cooked. Use a fork to crush a few of the potato chunks against the side of the pan to help thicken – you still want lots of defined chunks though. Stir through the clam meat and the few clam shells, if you ve gone down that route, and simmer for a minute to reheat. Season with plenty of black pepper and a little salt, if needed, then stir through the parsley just before ladling into bowls or hollowed-out crusty rolls.	https://www.themealdb.com/images/media/meals/rvtvuw1511190488.jpg	null	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEN_fm6kX6k	2020-10-27 21:11:28	2020-10-27 21:11:28	Clams	Butter	Bacon	Onion	Thyme	Bay Leaf	Plain Flour	Milk	Double Cream	Potatoes	Parsley										1½ kg	50g	150g	1 finely chopped	sprigs of fresh	1	1 tbls	150ml	150ml	2 medium	Chopped									
51	Creamy Tomato Soup	British	Put the oil, onions, celery, carrots, potatoes and bay leaves in a big casserole dish, or two saucepans. Fry gently until the onions are softened – about 10-15 mins. Fill the kettle and boil it. Stir in the tomato purée, sugar, vinegar, chopped tomatoes and passata, then crumble in the stock cubes. Add 1 litre boiling water and bring to a simmer. Cover and simmer for 15 mins until the potato is tender, then remove the bay leaves. Purée with a stick blender (or ladle into a blender in batches) until very smooth. Season to taste and add a pinch more sugar if it needs it. The soup can now be cooled and chilled for up to 2 days, or frozen for up to 3 months. To serve, reheat the soup, stirring in the milk – try not to let it boil. Serve in small bowls with cheesy sausage rolls.	https://www.themealdb.com/images/media/meals/stpuws1511191310.jpg	Baking	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBhwjjUiFk4	2020-10-27 21:11:28	2020-10-27 21:11:28	Olive Oil	Onions	Celery	Carrots	Potatoes	Bay Leaf	Tomato Puree	Sugar	White Vinegar	Chopped Tomatoes	Passata	Vegetable Stock Cube	Whole Milk								3 tbsp	2 chopped	2 sticks	300g	500g	4	5 tblsp	2 tblsp	2 tblsp	1½ kg	500g	3	400ml							
52	Chicken & mushroom Hotpot	British	Heat oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Put the butter in a medium-size saucepan and place over a medium heat. Add the onion and leave to cook for 5 mins, stirring occasionally. Add the mushrooms to the saucepan with the onions. Once the onion and mushrooms are almost cooked, stir in the flour – this will make a thick paste called a roux. If you are using a stock cube, crumble the cube into the roux now and stir well. Put the roux over a low heat and stir continuously for 2 mins – this will cook the flour and stop the sauce from having a floury taste. Take the roux off the heat. Slowly add the fresh stock, if using, or pour in 500ml water if you’ve used a stock cube, stirring all the time. Once all the liquid has been added, season with pepper, a pinch of nutmeg and mustard powder. Put the saucepan back onto a medium heat and slowly bring it to the boil, stirring all the time. Once the sauce has thickened, place on a very low heat. Add the cooked chicken and vegetables to the sauce and stir well. Grease a medium-size ovenproof pie dish with a little butter and pour in the chicken and mushroom filling. Carefully lay the potatoes on top of the hot-pot filling, overlapping them slightly, almost like a pie top. Brush the potatoes with a little melted butter and cook in the oven for about 35 mins. The hot-pot is ready once the potatoes are cooked and golden brown.	https://www.themealdb.com/images/media/meals/uuuspp1511297945.jpg	null	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXKWu4GojNI	2020-10-27 21:11:28	2020-10-27 21:11:28	Butter	Onion	Mushrooms	Plain Flour	Chicken Stock Cube	Nutmeg	Mustard Powder	Chicken	Sweetcorn	Potatoes	Butter										50g	1 chopped	100g	40g	1	pinch	pinch	250g	2 Handfuls	2 large	1 knob									
55	Choc Chip Pecan Pie	American	First, make the pastry. Tip the ingredients into a food processor with 1 /4 tsp salt. Blend until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs. Drizzle 2-3 tsp cold water into the funnel while the blade is running – the mixture should start to clump together. Tip onto a work surface and bring together, kneading briefly into a ball. Pat into a disc, wrap in cling film, and chill for at least 20 mins. Heat oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Remove the pastry from the fridge and leave at room temperature for 5 mins to soften. Flour the work surface, then unwrap the pastry and roll to a circle the thickness of a £1 coin. Use the pastry to line a deep, 23cm round fluted tin – mine was about 3cm deep. Press the pastry into the corners and up the sides, making sure there are no gaps. Leave 1cm pastry overhanging (save some of the pastry scraps for later). Line with baking parchment (scrunch it up first to make it more pliable) and fill with baking beans. Blind-bake for 15-20 mins until the sides are set, then remove the parchment and beans and return to the oven for 5 mins until golden brown. Trim the pastry so it’s flush with the top of the tin – a small serrated knife is best for this. If there are any cracks, patch them up with the pastry scraps. Meanwhile, weigh the butter, syrup and sugars into a pan, and add 1 /4 tsp salt. Heat until the butter has melted and the sugar dissolved, stirring until smooth. Remove from the heat and cool for 10 mins. Reduce oven to 160C/140C fan/gas 3. Beat the eggs in a bowl. Add the syrup mixture, vanilla and pecans, and mix until well combined. Pour half the mixture into the tart case, scatter over half the chocolate chips, then cover with the remaining filling and chocolate chips. Bake on the middle shelf for 50-55 mins until set. Remove from the oven and leave to cool, then chill for at least 2 hrs before serving.	https://www.themealdb.com/images/media/meals/rqvwxt1511384809.jpg	Pie,Desert,Sweet,Nutty	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDpoT0jvg4Y	2020-10-27 21:11:28	2020-10-27 21:11:28	Plain Flour	Butter	Cream Cheese	Icing Sugar	Butter	Maple Syrup	Light Brown Soft Sugar	Dark Brown Soft Sugar	Eggs	Vanilla Extract	Pecan Nuts	Dark Chocolate Chips									300g	75g	100g	1 tbls	150g	200ml	250g	100g	4	1 tsp	400g	200g

Put the chocolate, butter and sugar in a pan and gently melt, stirring occasionally with a wooden spoon. Remove from the heat. Stir the eggs, one by one, into the melted chocolate mixture. Sieve over the flour and cocoa, and stir in. Stir in half the raspberries, scrape into the tray, then scatter over the remaining raspberries. Bake on the middle shelf for 30 mins or, if you prefer a firmer texture, for 5 mins more. Cool before slicing into squares.

57	Chickpea Fajitas	Mexican	Heat oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6 and line a baking tray with foil. Drain the chickpeas, pat dry and tip onto the prepared baking tray. Add the oil and paprika, toss to coat, then roast for 20-25 mins until browned and crisp, shaking halfway through cooking. Meanwhile, put the tomatoes and onion in a small bowl with the vinegar and set aside to pickle. Put the avocado in another bowl and mash with a fork, leaving some larger chunks. Stir in the lime juice and season well. Mix the soured cream with the harissa and set aside until ready to serve. Heat a griddle pan until nearly smoking. Add the tortillas , one at a time, charring each side until hot with griddle lines. Put everything on the table and build the fajitas : spread a little of the harissa cream over the tortilla, top with roasted chickpeas, guacamole, pickled salsa and coriander, if you like. Serve with the lime wedges for squeezing over.	https://www.themealdb.com/images/media/meals/tvtxpq1511464705.jpg	Vegetarian	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGY3V7EGpT0	2020-10-27 21:11:28	2020-10-27 21:11:28	Chickpeas	Olive Oil	Paprika	Tomatoes	Red Onions	Red Wine Vinegar	Avocado	Lime	Lime	Sour Cream	Harissa Spice	Corn Tortillas	Coriander								400g	1 tblsp	pinch	2 small cut chunks	1 finely sliced	2 tsp	1	Juice of 1	Chopped	100g	2 tsp	4	to serve							
58	Chicken Ham and Leek Pie	British	Heat the chicken stock in a lidded saucepan. Add the chicken breast and bring to a low simmer. Cover with a lid and cook for 10 minutes. Remove the chicken breasts from the water with tongs and place on a plate. Pour the cooking liquor into a large jug. Melt 25g/1oz of the butter in a large heavy-based saucepan over a low heat. Stir in the leeks and fry gently for two minutes, stirring occasionally until just softened. Add the garlic and cook for a further minute. Add the remaining butter and stir in the flour as soon as the butter has melted. Cook for 30 seconds, stirring constantly. Slowly pour the milk into the pan, just a little at a time, stirring well between each adding. Gradually add 250ml/10fl oz of the reserved stock and the wine, if using, stirring until the sauce is smooth and thickened slightly. Bring to a gentle simmer and cook for 3 minutes. Season the mixture, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Remove from the heat and stir in the cream. Pour into a large bowl and cover the surface of the sauce with cling ilm to prevent a skin forming. Set aside to cool. Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6. Put a baking tray in the oven to heat. For the pastry, put the flour and butter in a food processor and blend on the pulse setting until the mixture resembles fine breadcrumbs. With the motor running, add the beaten egg and water and blend until the mixture forms a ball. Portion off 250g/10oz of pastry for the lid. Roll the remaining pastry out on a lightly floured surface, turning the pastry frequently until around 5mm/¼in thick and 4cm/1½in larger than the pie dish. Lift the pastry over the rolling pin and place it gently into the pie dish. Press the pastry firmly up the sides, making sure there are no air bubbles. Leave the excess pastry overhanging the sides. Cut the chicken breasts into 3cm/1¼in pieces. Stir the chicken, ham and leeks into the cooled sauce. Pour the chicken filling into the pie dish. Brush the rim of the dish with beaten egg. Roll out the reserved pastry for the lid. Cover the pie with the pastry lid and press the edges together firmly to seal. Trim any excess pastry. Make a small hole in the centre of the pie with the tip of a knife. Glaze the top of the pie with beaten egg. Bake on the preheated tray in the centre of the oven for 35-40 minutes or until the pie is golden-brown all over and the filling is piping hot.	https://www.themealdb.com/images/media/meals/xrrtss1511555269.jpg	Pie,Meat	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xr-CpPE_lNk	2020-10-27 21:11:28	2020-10-27 21:11:28	Chicken Stock	Chicken Breast	Butter	Leek	Garlic	Plain Flour	Milk	White Wine	Double Cream	Ham	Sea Salt	Pepper	Plain Flour	Butter	Free-range Egg, Beaten	Cold Water	Free-range Egg, Beaten				450ml	3	75g	2 sliced	2 cloves minced	50g	200ml	3 tbs	150ml	150g	spinkling	pinch	350g	200g	1	1 tbls	1			
59	Chicken Parmentier	French	For the topping, boil the potatoes in salted water until tender. Drain and push through a potato ricer, or mash thoroughly. Stir in the butter, cream and egg yolks. Season and set aside. For the filling, melt the butter in a large pan. Add the shallots, carrots and celery and gently fry until soft, then add the garlic. Pour in the wine and cook for 1 minute. Stir in the tomato purée, chopped tomatoes and stock and cook for 10–15 minutes, until thickened. Add the shredded chicken, olives and parsley. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Preheat the oven to 180C/160C Fan/Gas 4. Put the filling in a 20x30cm/8x12in ovenproof dish and top with the mashed potato. Grate over the Gruyère. Bake for 30–35 minutes, until piping hot and the potato is golden-brown.	https://www.themealdb.com/images/media/meals/uwvxpv1511557015.jpg	Meat,Dairy	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiG-xlmeyjg	2020-10-27 21:11:28	2020-10-27 21:11:28	Potatoes	Butter	Double Cream	Egg Yolks	Butter	Shallots	Carrots	Celery	Garlic Clove	White Wine	Tomato Puree	Tinned Tomatos	Chicken Stock	Chicken	Black Olives	Parsley	Gruyere cheese				1.5kg	30g	5 tblsp	2	30g	7	3 chopped	2 sticks	1 finely chopped	4 tbsp	1 tbls	400g	350ml	600g	16	2 tbs	50g			
61	Chelsea Buns	British	Sift the flour and salt into a large bowl. Make a well in the middle and add the yeast. Meanwhile, warm the milk and butter in a saucepan until the butter melts and the mixture is lukewarm. Add the milk mixture and egg to the flour mixture and stir until the contents of the bowl come together as a soft dough. (You may need to add a little extra flour.) Tip the dough onto a generously floured work surface. Knead for five minutes, adding more flour if necessary, until the dough is smooth and elastic and no longer feels sticky. Lightly oil a bowl with a little of the vegetable oil. Place the dough into the bowl and turn until it is covered in the oil. Cover the bowl with cling film and set aside in a warm place for one hour, or until the dough has doubled in size. Lightly grease a baking tray. For the filling, knock the dough back to its original size and turn out onto a lightly floured work surface. Roll the dough out into a rectangle 0.5cm/¼in thick. Brush all over with the melted butter, then sprinkle over the brown sugar, cinnamon and dried fruit. Roll the dough up into a tight cylinder , cut ten 4cm/1½in slice and place them onto a lightly greased baking sheet, leaving a little space between each slice. Cover with a tea towel and set aside to rise for 30 minutes. Preheat oven to 190C/375F/Gas 5. Bake the buns in the oven for 20-25 minutes, or until risen and golden-brown. Meanwhile, for the glaze, heat the milk and sugar in a saucepan until boiling. Reduce the heat and simmer for 2-3 minutes. Remove the buns from the oven and brush with the glaze, then set aside to cool on a wire rack.	https://www.themealdb.com/images/media/meals/vqpwrv1511723001.jpg	Bun,Baking,Treat	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_zemP3yBKw	2020-10-27 21:11:28	2020-10-27 21:11:28	White Flour	Salt	Yeast	Milk	Butter	Eggs	Vegetable Oil	Butter	Brown Sugar	Cinnamon	Dried Fruit	Milk	Caster Sugar								500g	1 tsp	7g	300ml	40g	1	Dash	25g	75g	2 tsp	150g	2 tbs	2 tbs							
62	Chocolate Souffle	French	Heat oven to 220C/fan 200C/gas 7 and place a baking tray on the top shelf. For the sauce, heat the cream and sugar until boiling. Remove from the heat, stir in the chocolate and butter until melted, then keep warm. Brush 6 x 150ml ramekins with melted butter, sprinkle with the 2 tbsp caster sugar, then tip out any excess. Melt the chocolate and cream in a bowl over a pan of simmering water, cool, then mix in the egg yolks. Whisk the egg whites until they hold their shape, then add the sugar, 1 tbsp at a time, whisking back to the same consistency. Mix a spoonful into the chocolate, then gently fold in the rest. Working quickly, fill the ramekins, wipe the rims clean and run your thumb around the edges. Turn oven down to 200C/fan 180C/gas 6, place the ramekins onto the baking tray, then bake for 8-10 mins until risen with a slight wobble. Don’t open the oven door too early as this may make them collapse. Once the soufflés are ready, dust with icing sugar, scoop a small hole from their tops, then pour in some of the hot chocolate sauce. Replace the lids and serve straight away.	https://www.themealdb.com/images/media/meals/twspvx1511784937.jpg	DinnerParty,Desert,Pudding,Chocolate	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWqfkUEWOTg	2020-10-27 21:11:28	2020-10-27 21:11:28	Single Cream	Caster Sugar	Dark Chocolate	Butter	Butter	Caster Sugar	Dark Chocolate	Double Cream	Egg Yolks	Egg White	Double Cream	Icing Sugar									142ml	25g	100g	25g	drizzle	50g	175g	2 tbs	4	5	2 tbs	to serve								
63	Chinon Apple Tarts	French	To make the red wine jelly, put the red wine, jam sugar, star anise, clove, cinnamon stick, allspice, split vanilla pod and seeds in a medium saucepan. Stir together, then heat gently to dissolve the sugar. Turn up the heat and boil for 20 mins until reduced and syrupy. Strain into a small, sterilised jam jar and leave to cool completely. Will keep in the fridge for up to 1 month. Take the pastry out of the fridge and leave at room temperature for 10 mins, then unroll. Heat the grill to high and heat the oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Cut out 2 x 13cm circles of pastry, using a plate as a guide, and place on a non-stick baking sheet. Sprinkle each circle with 1 tbsp sugar and grill for 5 mins to caramelise, watching carefully so that the sugar doesn’t burn. Remove from the grill. Can be done a few hours ahead, and left, covered, out of the fridge. Peel, quarter and core the apples, cut into 2mm-thin slices and arrange on top of the pastry. Sprinkle over the remaining sugar and pop in the oven for 20-25 mins until the pastry is cooked through and golden, and the apples are softened. Remove and allow to cool slightly. Warm 3 tbsp of the red wine jelly in a small pan over a low heat with 1 tsp water to make it a little more runny, then brush over the top of the tarts. Tip the crème fraîche into a bowl, sift over the icing sugar and cardamom, and mix together. Carefully lift the warm tarts onto serving plates and serve with the cardamom crème fraîche.	https://www.themealdb.com/images/media/meals/qtqwwu1511792650.jpg	Tart,Baking	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5dAW9HQgtCk	2020-10-27 21:11:28	2020-10-27 21:11:28	Puff Pastry	Dark Brown Soft Sugar	Braeburn Apples	Red Wine Jelly	Creme Fraiche	Icing Sugar	Cardamom														320g	4 tbs	3	4 tbs	100ml	1 tbs	3

Add the chicken legs and cook briefly on each side to colour them a little. Pour in the passata, crumble in the stock cube and stir in the olives. Season with black pepper – you shouldn’t need salt. Cover and simmer for 40 mins until the chicken is tender. Sprinkle with parsley and serve with pasta and a salad, or mash and green veg, if you like.	https://www.themealdb.com/images/media/meals/qpxvuq1511798906.jpg	null	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U33HYUr-0Fw	2020-10-27 21:11:28	2020-10-27 21:11:28	Olive Oil	Mushrooms	Chicken Legs	Passata	Chicken Stock Cube	Black Olives	Parsley														1 tbs	300g	4	500g	1	100g	Chopped													
65	Canadian Butter Tarts	Canadian	Preheat the oven to fan 170C/ conventional 190C/gas 5. Roll out the pastry on a lightly floured surface so it’s slightly thinner than straight from the pack. Then cut out 18-20 rounds with a 7.5cm fluted cutter, re-rolling the trimmings. Use the rounds to line two deep 12-hole tart tins (not muffin tins). If you only have a regular-sized, 12-hole tart tin you will be able to make a few more slightly shallower tarts. Beat the eggs in a large bowl and combine with the rest of the ingredients except the walnuts. Tip this mixture into a pan and stir continuously for 3-4 minutes until the butter melts, and the mixture bubbles and starts to thicken. It should be thick enough to coat the back of a wooden spoon. Don’t overcook, and be sure to stir all the time as the mixture can easily burn. Remove from the heat and stir in the nuts. Spoon the filling into the unbaked tart shells so it’s level with the pastry. Bake for 15-18 minutes until set and pale golden. Leave in the tin to cool for a few minutes before lifting out on to a wire rack. Serve warm or cold.	https://www.themealdb.com/images/media/meals/wpputp1511812960.jpg	Speciality,Snack,Desert,Pudding	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUpaOGghOdo	2020-10-27 21:11:28	2020-10-27 21:11:28	Shortcrust Pastry	Eggs	Muscovado Sugar	Raisins	Vanilla Extract	Butter	Single Cream	Walnuts													375g	2 large	175g	100g	1 tsp	50g	4 tsp	50g												
66	Chicken Basquaise	French	Preheat the oven to 180°C/Gas mark 4. Have the chicken joints ready to cook. Heat the butter and 3 tbsp olive oil in a flameproof casserole or large frying pan. Brown the chicken pieces in batches on both sides, seasoning them with salt and pepper as you go. Don t crowd the pan - fry the chicken in small batches, removing the pieces to kitchen paper as they are done. Add a little more olive oil to the casserole and fry the onions over a medium heat for 10 minutes, stirring frequently, until softened but not browned. Add the rest of the oil, then the peppers and cook for another 5 minutes. Add the chorizo, sun-dried tomatoes and garlic and cook for 2-3 minutes. Add the rice, stirring to ensure it is well coated in the oil. Stir in the tomato paste, paprika, bay leaves and chopped thyme. Pour in the stock and wine. When the liquid starts to bubble, turn the heat down to a gentle simmer. Press the rice down into the liquid if it isn t already submerged and place the chicken on top. Add the lemon wedges and olives around the chicken. Cover and cook in the oven for 50 minutes. The rice should be cooked but still have some bite, and the chicken should have juices that run clear when pierced in the thickest part with a knife. If not, cook for another 5 minutes and check again.	https://www.themealdb.com/images/media/meals/wruvqv1511880994.jpg	Meat	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emfm6TwsVhg	2020-10-27 21:11:28	2020-10-27 21:11:28	Chicken	Butter	Olive Oil	Red Onions	Red Pepper	Chorizo	Sun-Dried Tomatoes	Garlic	Basmati Rice	Tomato Puree	Paprika	Bay Leaves	Thyme	Chicken Stock	Dry White Wine	Lemons	Black Olives	Salt	Pepper		1.5kg	25g	6 tblsp	2 sliced	3 Large	130g	8	6 cloves sliced	300g	drizzle	½ tsp	4	Handful	350ml	180g	2	100g	to serve	to serve	
67	Callaloo Jamaican Style	Jamaican	Cut leaves and soft stems from the kale branches, them soak in a bowl of cold water for about 5-10 minutes or until finish with prep. Proceed to slicing the onions, mincing the garlic and dicing the tomatoes. Set aside Remove kale from water cut in chunks. Place bacon on saucepan and cook until crispy. Then add onions, garlic, thyme, stir for about a minute or more Add tomatoes; scotch bonnet pepper, smoked paprika. Sauté for about 2-3 more minutes. Finally add vegetable, salt, mix well, and steamed for about 6-8 minutes or until leaves are tender. Add a tiny bit of water as needed. Adjust seasonings and turn off the heat. Using a sharp knife cut both ends off the plantain. This will make it easy to grab the skin of the plantains. Slit a shallow line down the long seam of the plantain; peel only as deep as the peel. Remove plantain peel by pulling it back. Slice the plantain into medium size lengthwise slices and set aside. Coat a large frying pan with cooking oil spray. Spray the tops of the plantains with a generous layer of oil spray and sprinkle with salt, freshly ground pepper. Let the plantains fry on medium heat, shaking the frying pan to redistribute them every few minutes. As the plantains brown, continue to add more cooking oil spray, salt and pepper (if needed) until they have reached the desired color and texture.

STEP 2 - BOILING THE WHITE RICE Next add 8 cups of water and then set the stove on high heat until it is boiling. Once rice porridge starts to boil, set the stove on low heat and then stir it once every 8-10 minutes for around 20-25 minutes. After 25 minutes, this is optional but you can add a little bit more water to make rice porridge to make it less thick or to your preference. Next add the marinated chicken to the rice porridge and leave the stove on low heat for another 10 minutes. After an additional 10 minutes add the green onions, sliced ginger, 1 pinch of salt, 1 pinch of white pepper and stir for 10 seconds. Serve the rice porridge in a bowl Optional: add Coriander on top of the rice porridge.	https://www.themealdb.com/images/media/meals/1529446352.jpg	null	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqEfk801E94	2020-10-27 21:11:28	2020-10-27 21:11:28	Chicken	Salt	Pepper	Ginger Cordial	Ginger	Spring Onions	Rice	Water	Coriander												8 oz	pinch	pinch	1 tsp	1 tsp	1 tbs	1/2 cup	8 cups	2 oz

Add the peppers and garlic, and sauté for an additional 3-5 minutes. Add the tomatoes, cumin, paprika, salt, and chili powder. Mix well and bring the mixture to a simmer. Reduce the heat to medium low and continue to simmer, uncovered, 10-15 minutes until the mixture has thickened to your desired consistency. (Taste the sauce at this point and adjust for salt and spice, as desired.) Using the back of a spoon, make four craters in the mixture, large enough to hold an egg. Crack one egg into each of the craters. Cover the skillet and simmer for 5-7 minutes, until the eggs have set. Serve immediately with crusty bread or pita.	https://www.themealdb.com/images/media/meals/gpz67p1560458984.jpg	null	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHKNu93MSx4	2020-10-27 21:11:28	2020-10-27 21:11:28	Tomatoes	Olive Oil	Onion	Red Pepper	Green Pepper	Garlic	Cumin	Paprika	Salt	Chili Powder	Eggs										4	2 tbs	1 Diced	1 sliced	1 sliced	3 Cloves Crushed	1 tsp	1 tsp	3/4 teaspoon	1/2 teaspoon	4

72	Corba	Turkish	Pick through your lentils for any foreign debris, rinse them 2 or 3 times, drain, and set aside. Fair warning, this will probably turn your lentils into a solid block that you’ll have to break up later In a large pot over medium-high heat, sauté the olive oil and the onion with a pinch of salt for about 3 minutes, then add the carrots and cook for another 3 minutes. Add the tomato paste and stir it around for around 1 minute. Now add the cumin, paprika, mint, thyme, black pepper, and red pepper as quickly as you can and stir for 10 seconds to bloom the spices. Congratulate yourself on how amazing your house now smells. Immediately add the lentils, water, broth, and salt. Bring the soup to a (gentle) boil. After it has come to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, cover the pot halfway, and cook for 15-20 minutes or until the lentils have fallen apart and the carrots are completely cooked. After the soup has cooked and the lentils are tender, blend the soup either in a blender or simply use a hand blender to reach the consistency you desire. Taste for seasoning and add more salt if necessary. Serve with crushed-up crackers, torn up bread, or something else to add some extra thickness. You could also use a traditional thickener (like cornstarch or flour), but I prefer to add crackers for some texture and saltiness. Makes great leftovers, stays good in the fridge for about a week.	https://www.themealdb.com/images/media/meals/58oia61564916529.jpg	Soup	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVnZd8A84z4	2020-10-27 21:11:28	2020-10-27 21:11:28	Lentils	Onion	Carrots	Tomato Puree	Cumin	Paprika	Mint	Thyme	Black Pepper	Red Pepper Flakes	Vegetable Stock	Water	Sea Salt								1 cup	1 large	1 large	1 tbs	2 tsp	1 tsp	1/2 tsp	1/2 tsp	1/4 tsp	1/4 tsp	4 cups	1 cup	Pinch

Sprinkle with the demerara sugar followed by the Grand Marnier and set aside. Crumble the Christmas pudding into large pieces and scatter over the bottom of a trifle bowl. Lift the oranges onto the pudding in a layer and pour over any juices. Beat the mascarpone until smooth, then stir in the custard. Spoon the mixture over the top of the oranges. Lightly whip the cream and spoon over the custard. Sprinkle with the flaked almonds and grated chocolate. You can make this a day in advance if you like, chill until ready to serve.	https://www.themealdb.com/images/media/meals/r33cud1576791081.jpg	Christmas	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRfyNQs5qhU	2020-10-27 21:11:28	2020-10-27 21:11:28	Orange	Demerara Sugar	Grand Marnier	Christmas Pudding	Custard	Mascarpone	Double Cream	Flaked Almonds	Dark Chocolate												3	1 tbs	2 tbs	300g	500g	250g	284ml	Handful	Grated											
74	Classic Christmas pudding	British	Get everything for the pudding prepared. Chop the almonds coarsely. Peel, core and chop the cooking apples. Sharpen your knife and chop the candied peel. (You can chop the almonds and apples in a food processor, but the peel must be done by hand.) Grate three quarters of the nutmeg (sounds a lot but it s correct). Mix the almonds, apples, candied peel, nutmeg, raisins, flour, breadcrumbs, light muscovado sugar, eggs and 2 tbsp brandy or cognac in a large bowl. Holding the butter in its wrapper, grate a quarter of it into the bowl, then stir everything together. Repeat until all the butter is grated, then stir for 3-4 mins – the mixture is ready when it subsides slightly after each stir. Ask the family to stir too, and get everyone to make a wish. Generously butter two 1.2 litre bowls and put a circle of baking parchment in the bottom of each. Pack in the pudding mixture. Cover with a double layer of baking parchment, pleating it to allow for expansion, then tie with string (keep the paper in place with a rubber band while tying). Trim off any excess paper. Now stand each bowl on a large sheet of foil and bring the edges up over the top, then put another sheet of foil over the top and bring it down underneath to make a double package (this makes the puddings watertight). Tie with more string, and make a handle for easy lifting in and out of the pan. Watch our video to see how to tie up a pudding correctly. Boil or oven steam the puddings for 8 hrs, topping up with water as necessary. Remove from the pans and leave to cool overnight. When cold, discard the messy wrappings and re-wrap in new baking parchment, foil and string. Store in a cool, dry place until Christmas. To make the brandy butter, cream the butter with the orange zest and icing sugar. Gradually beat in the brandy or cognac and chopped stem ginger. Put in a small bowl, fork the top attractively and put in the fridge to set. The butter will keep for a week in the fridge, or it can be frozen for up to six weeks. On Christmas Day, boil or oven steam for 1 hr. Unwrap and turn out. To flame, warm 3-4 tbsp brandy in a small pan, pour it over the pudding and set light to it.	https://www.themealdb.com/images/media/meals/1d85821576790598.jpg	Christmas	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb_lJxL1vtk	2020-10-27 21:11:28	2020-10-27 21:11:28	Almonds	Bramley Apples	Candied Peel	Nutmeg	Raisins	Plain Flour	Breadcrumbs	Muscovado Sugar	Eggs	Brandy	Butter										50g	2 large	200g	1 whole	1kg	140g	100g	100g	3 Large	2 tbs	250g									
75	Christmas cake	British	Heat oven to 160C/fan 140C/gas 3. Line the base and sides of a 20 cm round, 7.5 cm deep cake tin. Beat the butter and sugar with an electric hand mixer for 1-2 mins until very creamy and pale in colour, scraping down the sides of the bowl half way through. Stir in a spoonful of the flour, then stir in the beaten egg and the rest of the flour alternately, a quarter at a time, beating well each time with a wooden spoon. Stir in the almonds. Mix in the sherry (the mix will look curdled), then add the peel, cherries, raisins, cherries, nuts, lemon zest, spice, rosewater and vanilla. Beat together to mix, then stir in the baking powder. Spoon mixture into the tin and smooth the top, making a slight dip in the centre. Bake for 30 mins, then lower temperature to 150C/fan 130C/gas 2 and bake a further 2-2¼ hrs, until a skewer insterted in the middle comes out clean. Leave to cool in the tin, then take out of the tin and peel off the lining paper. When completely cold, wrap well in cling film and foil to store until ready to decorate.

Remove the stems from one bunch of Tuscan kale and tear the leaves into 1 pieces (mustard greens, collards, spinach, and chard are great, too). Coarsely chop half a head of green cabbage. Combine the greens in a large baking dish and add 4 cloves of thinly sliced garlic. Adding some sliced onions and shiitake mushrooms at this point is optional, but highly recommended (I ll sauté the onions and mushrooms in a cast iron baking dish right on the stove before adding to the greens). Coat the greens with some olive oil and pour ½ cup chicken stock or broth over everything. Cover the dish with foil and bake until the greens are wilted, about 15 minutes. Remove foil and season with salt and pepper. Continue to bake until cabbage is tender, about 20-25 minutes more. Meanwhile, heat a little olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high. Prick four sweet Italian sausages with a fork and cook until browned on all sides and cooked through, 10 to 12 minutes.

79	Chick-Fil-A Sandwich	American	Wrap the chicken loosely between plastic wrap and pound gently with the flat side of a meat tenderizer until about 1/2 inch thick all around. Cut into two pieces, as even as possible. Marinate in the pickle juice for 30 minutes to one hour (add a teaspoon of Tabasco sauce now for a spicy sandwich). Beat the egg with the milk in a bowl. Combine the flour, sugar, and spices in another bowl. Dip the chicken pieces each into the egg on both sides, then coat in flour on both sides. Heat the oil in a skillet (1/2 inch deep) to about 345-350. Fry each cutlet for 2 minutes on each side, or until golden and cooked through. Blot on paper and serve on toasted buns with pickle slices.	https://www.themealdb.com/images/media/meals/sbx7n71587673021.jpg	null	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WDesu7bUDM	2020-10-27 21:11:28	2020-10-27 21:11:28	Chicken Breast	Pickle Juice	Egg	Milk	Flour	Icing Sugar	Paprika	Salt	Black Pepper	Garlic Powder	Celery Salt	Cayenne Pepper	Olive Oil	Sesame Seed Burger Buns							1	1/4 cup	1	1/4 cup	1/2 cup	1 tbs	1/2 tsp	1/2 tsp	1/4 tsp	1/4 tsp	1/4 tsp	1/2 tsp	1 cup	1						
80	Dal fry	Indian	Wash and soak toor dal in approx. 3 cups of water, for at least one hours. Dal will be double in volume after soaking. Drain the water. Cook dal with 2-1/2 cups water and add salt, turmeric, on medium high heat, until soft in texture (approximately 30 mins) it should be like thick soup. In a frying pan, heat the ghee. Add cumin seeds, and mustard seeds. After the seeds crack, add bay leaves, green chili, ginger and chili powder. Stir for a few seconds. Add tomatoes, salt and sugar stir and cook until tomatoes are tender and mushy. Add cilantro and garam masala cook for about one minute. Pour the seasoning over dal mix it well and cook for another minute. Serve with Naan.	https://www.themealdb.com/images/media/meals/wuxrtu1483564410.jpg	Curry,Vegetarian,Cake	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4D855Q9-jg	2020-10-27 21:11:28	2020-10-27 21:11:28	Toor dal	Water	Salt	Turmeric	Ghee	Chopped tomatoes	Cumin seeds	Mustard Seeds	Bay Leaf	Green Chili	Ginger	Cilantro	Red Pepper	Salt	Sugar	Garam Masala					1 cup	2-1/2 cups	1 tsp	1/4 tsp	3 tbs	1 cup	1/2 tsp	1/2 tsp	2	1 tbs chopped	2 tsp shredded	2 tbs	1/2 tsp	1/2 tsp	1 tsp	1/4 tsp				
81	Dundee cake	British	Put the almonds into a small bowl and pour over boiling water to just cover. Leave for 5 mins then drain in a sieve and leave to dry. Preheat the oven to 180C/160 C fan/Gas Mark 4. Line a deep loose-based 20cm cake tin with baking parchment. Put the butter in a large bowl and beat well until soft. Add the sugar and beat until light and fluffy. Stir in the orange zest and apricot jam. Sieve together the flour and baking powder. Add the eggs to the creamed butter and sugar, a little at a time, beating well between each addition. If the mixture starts to curdle, stir in a little flour. Add the remaining flour and ground almonds and mix well. Mix in the milk and then add the dried fruit and cherries and mix gently together. Spoon the mixture into the prepared tin and spread level using the back of a spoon. Arrange the whole almonds close together in neat circles on the top of the cake. Bake in the oven for 45 mins. Lower the oven temperature to 160C/140 C fan/Gas Mark 3 and cook for a further 60–80 minutes. Check the cake after 50 minutes by inserting a wooden or metal skewer into the cake. When it’s done it should have just a few crumbs attached. Check every 10 minutes - it’s important not to overcook this cake so the centre will be a little soft. When cooked, remove the cake briefly from the oven, put the milk and sugar into a small pan and heat gently until the sugar has dissolved. Brush over the top of the cake and return the cake to the oven for 2-3 mins. Remove and allow the cake to cool in the tin. When quite cold remove from the tin and wrap in foil and keep for at least 2 days before cutting.	https://www.themealdb.com/images/media/meals/wxyvqq1511723401.jpg	heavy,Nutty,Fruity	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hEXsfpeMQE	2020-10-27 21:11:28	2020-10-27 21:11:28	Almonds	Butter	Muscovado Sugar	Orange	Apricot Jam	Plain Flour	Baking Powder	Eggs	Ground Almonds	Milk	Dried Fruit	Glace Cherry	Milk	Caster Sugar							100g	180g	180g	Zest of 1	3 tbs	225g	1 tsp	3 Large	100g	2 tbs	500g	100g	1 tbs	2 tsp						
93	French Onion Soup	French	Melt the butter with the oil in a large heavy-based pan. Add the onions and fry with the lid on for 10 mins until soft. Sprinkle in the sugar and cook for 20 mins more, stirring frequently, until caramelised. The onions should be really golden, full of flavour and soft when pinched between your fingers. Take care towards the end to ensure that they don’t burn. Add the garlic for the final few mins of the onions’ cooking time, then sprinkle in the flour and stir well. Increase the heat and keep stirring as you gradually add the wine, followed by the hot stock. Cover and simmer for 15-20 mins. To serve, turn on the grill, and toast the bread. Ladle the soup into heatproof bowls. Put a slice or two of toast on top of the bowls of soup, and pile on the cheese. Grill until melted. Alternatively, you can complete the toasts under the grill, then serve them on top.	https://www.themealdb.com/images/media/meals/xvrrux1511783685.jpg	Soup	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DLDMQucqDI	2020-10-27 21:11:28	2020-10-27 21:11:28	Butter	Olive Oil	Onion	Sugar	Garlic Clove	Plain Flour	Dry White Wine	Beef Stock	Bread	Gruyère											50g	1 tbs	1 kg	1 tsp	4 sliced	2 tbs	250ml	1L	4 sliced	140g										
82	Duck Confit	French	The day before you want to make the dish, scatter half the salt, half the garlic and half of the herbs over the base of a small shallow dish. Lay the duck legs, skin-side up, on top, then scatter over the remaining salt, garlic and herbs. Cover the duck and refrigerate overnight. This can be done up to 2 days ahead. Pour the wine into a saucepan that will snugly fit the duck legs in a single layer. Brush the salt off the duck legs and place them, skin-side down, in the wine. Cover the pan with a lid and place over a medium heat. As soon as the wine starts to bubble, turn the heat down to the lowest setting and cook for 2 hours, checking occasionally that the liquid is just barely simmering. (If you own a heat diffuser, it would be good to use it here.) After 2 hours, the duck legs should be submerged in their own fat and the meat should feel incredibly tender when prodded. Leave to cool. The duck legs are now cooked and can be eaten immediately – or you can follow the next step if you like them crisp. If you are preparing ahead, pack the duck legs tightly into a plastic container or jar and pour over the fat, but not the liquid at the bottom of the pan. Cover and leave in the fridge for up to a month, or freeze for up to 3 months. The liquid you are left with makes a tasty gravy, which can be chilled or frozen until needed. To reheat and crisp up the duck legs, heat oven to 220C/fan 200C/gas 7. Remove the legs from the fat and place them, skin-side down, in an ovenproof frying pan. Roast for 30-40 mins, turning halfway through, until brown and crisp. Serve with the reheated gravy, a crisp salad and some crisp golden ptoatoes.	https://www.themealdb.com/images/media/meals/wvpvsu1511786158.jpg	null	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHhLJqghY-o	2020-10-27 21:11:28	2020-10-27 21:11:28	Sea Salt	Bay Leaf	Garlic	Thyme	Duck Legs	White Wine															Handful	4	4 cloves	Handful	4	100ml

84	Eccles Cakes	British	To make the pastry, dice the butter and put it in the freezer to go really hard. Tip flour into the bowl of a food processor with half the butter and pulse to the texture of breadcrumbs. Pour in the lemon juice and 100ml iced water, and pulse to a dough. Tip in the rest of the butter and pulse a few times until the dough is heavily flecked with butter. It is important that you don’t overdo this as the flecks of butter are what makes the pastry flaky. On a floured surface roll the pastry out to a neat rectangle about 20 x 30cm. Fold the two ends of the pastry into the middle (See picture 1), then fold in half (pic 2). Roll the pastry out again and refold the same way 3 more times resting the pastry for at least 15 mins each time between roll and fold, then leave to rest in the fridge for at least 30 mins before using. To make the filling, melt the butter in a large saucepan. Take it off the heat and stir in all the other ingredients until completely mixed, then set aside. To make the cakes, roll the pastry out until it’s just a little thicker than a £1 coin and cut out 8 rounds about 12cm across. Re-roll the trimming if needed. Place a good heaped tablespoon of mixture in the middle of each round, brush the edges of the rounds with water, then gather the pastry around the filling and squeeze it together (pic 3). Flip them over so the smooth top is upwards and pat them into a smooth round. Flatten each round with a rolling pin to an oval until the fruit just starts to poke through, then place on a baking tray. Cut 2 little slits in each Eccles cakes, brush generously with egg white and sprinkle with the sugar (pic 4). Heat the oven to 220C/200C fan/gas 8. Bake the Eccles cakes for 15-20 mins until just past golden brown and sticky. Leave to cool on a rack and enjoy while still warm or cold with a cup of tea. If you prefer, Eccles cakes also go really well served with a wedge of hard, tangy British cheese such as Lancashire or cheddar.	https://www.themealdb.com/images/media/meals/wtqrqw1511639627.jpg	Snack,Treat	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xV0QCJ0GD5w	2020-10-27 21:11:28	2020-10-27 21:11:28	Butter	Plain Flour	Lemon	Butter	Currants	Mixed Peel	Muscovado Sugar	Cinnamon	Ginger	Allspice	Lemon	Eggs	Sugar								250g	350g	Juice of 1/2	25g	200g	50g	100g	1 tsp	1 tsp	1 tsp	Zest of 1	1 beaten	spinkling							
85	English Breakfast	British	Heat the flat grill plate over a low heat, on top of 2 rings/flames if it fits, and brush sparingly with light olive oil. Cook the sausages first. Add the sausages to the hot grill plate/the coolest part if there is one and allow to cook slowly for about 15-20 minutes, turning occasionally, until golden. After the first 10 minutes, increase the heat to medium before beginning to cook the other ingredients. If you are struggling for space, completely cook the sausages and keep hot on a plate in the oven. Snip a few small cuts into the fatty edge of the bacon. Place the bacon straight on to the grill plate and fry for 2-4 minutes each side or until your preferred crispiness is reached. Like the sausages, the cooked bacon can be kept hot on a plate in the oven. For the mushrooms, brush away any dirt using a pastry brush and trim the stalk level with the mushroom top. Season with salt and pepper and drizzle over a little olive oil. Place stalk-side up on the grill plate and cook for 1-2 minutes before turning and cooking for a further 3-4 minutes. Avoid moving the mushrooms too much while cooking, as this releases the natural juices, making them soggy. For the tomatoes, cut the tomatoes across the centre/or in half lengthways if using plum tomatoes , and with a small, sharp knife remove the green  eye . Season with salt and pepper and drizzle with a little olive oil. Place cut-side down on the grill plate and cook without moving for 2 minutes. Gently turn over and season again. Cook for a further 2-3 minutes until tender but still holding their shape. For the black pudding, cut the black pudding into 3-4 slices and remove the skin. Place on the grill plate and cook for 1½-2 minutes each side until slightly crispy. For  proper  fried bread it s best to cook it in a separate pan. Ideally, use bread that is a couple of days old. Heat a frying pan to a medium heat and cover the base with oil. Add the bread and cook for 2-3 minutes each side until crispy and golden. If the pan becomes too dry, add a little more oil. For a richer flavour, add a knob of butter after you turn the slice. For the fried eggs, break the egg straight into the pan with the fried bread and leave for 30 seconds. Add a good knob of butter and lightly splash/baste the egg with the butter when melted. Cook to your preferred stage, season and gently remove with a fish slice. Once all the ingredients are cooked, serve on warm plates and enjoy straight away with a good squeeze of tomato ketchup or brown sauce.	https://www.themealdb.com/images/media/meals/utxryw1511721587.jpg	Breakfast	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXjYU2Ensck	2020-10-27 21:11:28	2020-10-27 21:11:28	Sausages	Bacon	Mushrooms	Tomatoes	Black Pudding	Eggs	Bread														2	3	2	2	1 Slice	2	1 Slice

88	Egyptian Fatteh	Egyptian	To prepare bread for bottom of dish: Take pita bread and rip into bite size pieces. In a frying pan, add about a 1/4 stick of butter, add bread pieces and fry until golden brown and crisp. Put these pieces in a glass baking dish, preferably a square sized dish. Set aside. Then add to same pan, a little more butter, salt, approximately 2 cloves of crushed fresh garlic, and a teaspoon or so of cumin stir around a bit until you can smell aroma, then add fried bread pieces to this mixture, stir to coat bread and put back into glass baking dish. Set aside. To prepare meat: put some butter in a pot, stir fry meat until brown, add 1 onion quartered, salt & pepper, 1 cube of chicken bouillon and water to cover meat. Bring to a boil, turn down to simmer, cover and cook until tender, approximately 2 hours. After meat has cooled, take out chunks of meat and put in a bowl, set aside. Reserve soup from the meat separately. To prepare the rice: Put some butter into a pot, add shareya (fideo noodles) like a handful or so, keep stirring until golden brown, not too dark, but very golden. Then add two cups of rice, stir a little bit until some of the rice turns an opaque white. Add 2-1/4 cups of water and salt to taste. Bring to a boil, cover and turn down to simmer, cook until tender. Test the rice tenderness after about 35 minutes. Now take some of the soup from meat and add to the top of the bread pieces in baking dish to saturate.Add cooked rice on top of bread pieces. Slowly spoon remainder of soup onto rice, looking at glass dish sides to see level of soup, should reach just to top of rice, don’t worry, this doesn’t have to be exact. Now you’re ready to make the sauce and fry the meat to put on top. To prepare red sauce: In a pan, add a little oil or butter, crushed tomato, a half teaspoon of tomato paste, salt & pepper, 2 cloves of fresh crushed garlic and cumin. Add also approximately 3 tablespoons of vinegar, stir this until you smell aroma and it is a bit smooth. It should be a bit thick, not watery, but if too thick you can add a bit of water. Spread with a wooden spoon atop the rice to cover. To fry meat: In a pan add a bit of butter or oil, the meat, just a touch of tomato paste, about a tablespoon of fresh crushed garlic, salt & pepper, a teaspoon of cumin. Cook until meat is golden fried. Spoon this atop the rice and serve.

95	French Omelette	French	Get everything ready. Warm a 20cm (measured across the top) non-stick frying pan on a medium heat. Crack the eggs into a bowl and beat them with a fork so they break up and mix, but not as completely as you would for scrambled egg. With the heat on medium-hot, drop one knob of butter into the pan. It should bubble and sizzle, but not brown. Season the eggs with the Parmesan and a little salt and pepper, and pour into the pan. Let the eggs bubble slightly for a couple of seconds, then take a wooden fork or spatula and gently draw the mixture in from the sides of the pan a few times, so it gathers in folds in the centre. Leave for a few seconds, then stir again to lightly combine uncooked egg with cooked. Leave briefly again, and when partly cooked, stir a bit faster, stopping while there’s some barely cooked egg left. With the pan flat on the heat, shake it back and forth a few times to settle the mixture. It should slide easily in the pan and look soft and moist on top. A quick burst of heat will brown the underside. Grip the handle underneath. Tilt the pan down away from you and let the omelette fall to the edge. Fold the side nearest to you over by a third with your fork, and keep it rolling over, so the omelette tips onto a plate – or fold it in half, if that’s easier. For a neat finish, cover the omelette with a piece of kitchen paper and plump it up a bit with your fingers. Rub the other knob of butter over to glaze. Serve immediately.	https://www.themealdb.com/images/media/meals/yvpuuy1511797244.jpg	Egg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXPhVYpQLPA	2020-10-27 21:11:28	2020-10-27 21:11:28	Eggs	Butter	Parmesan	Tarragon	Parsley	Chives	Gruyère														3	2 knobs	1 tsp	3 chopped	1 tbs chopped	1 tbs chopped	4 tbs													
96	Fish Stew with Rouille	French	Twist the heads from the prawns, then peel away the legs and shells, but leave the tails intact. Devein each prawn. Fry the shells in 1 tbsp oil for 5 mins, until dark pink and golden in patches. Add the wine, boil down by two thirds, then pour in the stock. Strain into a jug, discarding the shells. Heat the rest of the oil in a deep frying pan or casserole. Add the fennel, onion and garlic, season, then cover and gently cook for 10 mins until softened. Meanwhile, peel the potato and cut into 2cm-ish chunks. Put into a pan of cold water, bring to the boil and cook for 5 mins until almost tender. Drain in a colander. Peel a strip of zest from the orange. Put the zest, star anise, bay and ½ tsp harissa into the pan. Fry gently, uncovered, for 5-10 mins, until the vegetables are soft, sweet and golden. Stir in the tomato purée, cook for 2 mins, then add the tomatoes and stock. Simmer for 10 mins until the sauce thickens slightly. Season to taste. The sauce can be made ahead, then reheated later in the day. Meantime, scrub the mussels or clams and pull away any stringy beards. Any that are open should be tapped sharply on the worktop – if they don’t close after a few seconds, discard them. Reheat the sauce if necessary, then stir the potato, chunks of fish and prawns very gently into the stew. Bring back to the boil, then cover and gently simmer for 3 mins. Scatter the mussels or clams over the stew, then cover and cook for 2 mins more or until the shells have opened wide. Discard any that remain closed. The chunks of fish should flake easily and the prawns should be pink through. Scatter with the thyme leaves. To make the quick rouille, stir the rest of the harissa through the mayonnaise. Serve the stew in bowls, topped with spoonfuls of rouille, which will melt into the sauce and enrich it. Have some good bread ready, as you’ll definitely want to mop up the juices.	https://www.themealdb.com/images/media/meals/vptqpw1511798500.jpg	Fish,Seafood,Shellfish	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fp9Lqx2EUco	2020-10-27 21:11:28	2020-10-27 21:11:28	Prawns	Olive Oil	Dry White Wine	Fish Stock	Fennel	Onion	Garlic	Potatoes	Orange	Star Anise	Bay Leaf	Harissa Spice	Tomato Puree	Chopped Tomatoes	Mussels	White Fish	Thyme	Bread			6 large	3 tbs	150ml	200ml	1 small finely diced	1 small finely diced	3 cloves Chopped	1 large	1	1	1	1 1/2 tsp	2 tbs	400g	Handful	200g	2	to serve

98	Fruit and Cream Cheese Breakfast Pastries	American	Preheat oven to 400ºF (200ºC), and prepare two cookie sheets with parchment paper. In a bowl, mix cream cheese, sugar, and vanilla until fully combined. Lightly flour the surface and roll out puff pastry on top to flatten. Cut each sheet of puff pastry into 9 equal squares. On the top right and bottom left of the pastry, cut an L shape approximately ½ inch (1 cm) from the edge. NOTE: This L shape should reach all the way down and across the square, however both L shapes should not meet at the ends. Your pastry should look like a picture frame with two corners still intact. Take the upper right corner and fold down towards the inner bottom corner. You will now have a diamond shape. Place 1 to 2 teaspoons of the cream cheese filling in the middle, then place berries on top. Repeat with the remaining pastry squares and place them onto the parchment covered baking sheet. Bake for 15-20 minutes or until pastry is golden brown and puffed.

99	French Onion Chicken with Roasted Carrots & Mashed Potatoes	American	1 Preheat oven to 425 degrees. Wash and dry all produce. Trim, peel, and cut carrots on a diagonal into ¼-inch-thick pieces. Dice potatoes into ½-inch pieces. Halve, peel, and thinly slice onion. 2 Toss carrots on a baking sheet with a drizzle of oil, salt, and pepper. Roast until browned and tender, 15-20 minutes. 3 Meanwhile, place potatoes in a medium pot with enough salted water to cover by 2 inches. Bring to a boil and cook until tender, 12-15 minutes. Drain and return potatoes to pot; cover to keep warm. 4 While potatoes cook, heat a drizzle of oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Add onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until lightly browned and softened, 8-10 minutes. Sprinkle with 1 tsp sugar (2 tsp for 4 servings). Stir in stock concentrate and 2 TBSP water (¼ cup for 4); season with salt and pepper. Cook until jammy, 2-3 minutes more. Turn off heat; transfer to a small bowl. Wash out pan. 5 Pat chicken dry with paper towels; season all over with salt and pepper. Heat a drizzle of oil in pan used for onion over medium-high heat. Add chicken and cook until browned and cooked through, 5-6 minutes per side. In the last 1-2 minutes of cooking, top with caramelized onion and cheese. Cover pan until cheese melts. (If your pan doesn’t have a lid, cover with a baking sheet!) 6 Heat pot with drained potatoes over low heat; mash with sour cream, 2 TBSP butter (4 TBSP for 4 servings), salt, pepper, and a splash of water (or milk, for extra richness) until smooth. Divide chicken, roasted carrots, and mashed potatoes between plates.	https://www.themealdb.com/images/media/meals/b5ft861583188991.jpg	null		2020-10-27 21:11:28	2020-10-27 21:11:28	Chicken Breasts	Carrots	Small Potatoes	Onion	Beef Stock	Mozzarella	Sour Cream	Butter	Sugar	Vegetable Oil	Salt	Pepper									2	12 ounces	5	1	1	1 1/2 cup	2 tbsp													
100	Ful Medames	Egyptian	As the cooking time varies depending on the quality and age of the beans, it is good to cook them in advance and to reheat them when you are ready to serve. Cook the drained beans in a fresh portion of unsalted water in a large saucepan with the lid on until tender, adding water to keep them covered, and salt when the beans have softened. They take 2–2 1/2 hours of gentle simmering. When the beans are soft, let the liquid reduce. It is usual to take out a ladle or two of the beans and to mash them with some of the cooking liquid, then stir this back into the beans. This is to thicken the sauce. Serve the beans in soup bowls sprinkled with chopped parsley and accompanied by Arab bread. Pass round the dressing ingredients for everyone to help themselves: a bottle of extra-virgin olive oil, the quartered lemons, salt and pepper, a little saucer with the crushed garlic, one with chili-pepper flakes, and one with ground cumin. The beans are eaten gently crushed with the fork, so that they absorb the dressing. Optional Garnishes Peel hard-boiled eggs—1 per person—to cut up in the bowl with the beans. Top the beans with a chopped cucumber-and-tomato salad and thinly sliced mild onions or scallions. Otherwise, pass round a good bunch of scallions and quartered tomatoes and cucumbers cut into sticks. Serve with tahina cream sauce (page 65) or salad (page 67), with pickles and sliced onions soaked in vinegar for 30 minutes. Another way of serving ful medames is smothered in a garlicky tomato sauce (see page 464). In Syria and Lebanon, they eat ful medames with yogurt or feta cheese, olives, and small cucumbers. Variations A traditional way of thickening the sauce is to throw a handful of red lentils (1/4 cup) into the water at the start of the cooking. In Iraq, large brown beans are used instead of the small Egyptian ones, in a dish called badkila, which is also sold for breakfast in the street.	https://www.themealdb.com/images/media/meals/lvn2d51598732465.jpg	null	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixpCabILuxw	2020-10-27 21:11:28	2020-10-27 21:11:28	Broad Beans	Parsley	Olive Oil	Lemons	Garlic Clove	Cumin															2 cups	1/3 cup	Dash	3	4	Sprinking														
101	Feteer Meshaltet	Egyptian	Mix the flour and salt then pour one cup of water and start kneading. If you feel the dough is still not coming together or too dry, gradually add the remaining water until you get a dough that is very elastic so that when you pull it and it won’t be torn. Let the dough rest for just 10 minutes then divide the dough into 6-8 balls depending on the size you want for your feteer. Warm up the butter/ghee or oil you are using and pour into a deep bowl. Immerse the dough balls into the warm butter. Let it rest for 15 to 20 minutes. Preheat oven to 550F. Stretch the first ball with your hands on a clean countertop. Stretch it as thin as you can, the goal here is to see your countertop through the dough. Fold the dough over itself to form a square brushing in between folds with the butter mixture. Set aside and start making the next ball. Stretch the second one thin as we have done for the first ball. Place the previous one on the middle seam side down. Fold the outer one over brushing with more butter mixture as you fold. Set aside. Keep doing this for the third and fourth balls. Now we have one ready, place on a 10 inch baking/pie dish seam side down and brush the top with more butter. Repeat for the remaining 4 balls to make a second one. With your hands lightly press the folded feteer to spread it on the baking dish. Place in preheated oven for 10 minutes when the feteer starts puffing turn on the broiler to brown the top. When it is done add little butter on top and cover so it won’t get dry.	https://www.themealdb.com/images/media/meals/9f4z6v1598734293.jpg	null	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mW1unsVhFU	2020-10-27 21:11:28	2020-10-27 21:11:28	Flour	Water	Salt	Unsalted Butter	Olive Oil																4 cups	1 1/2 cups	1/4 tsp	1 cup	1/4 cup															
102	Garides Saganaki	Greek	Place the prawns in a pot and add enough water to cover. Boil for 5 minutes. Drain, reserving the liquid, and set aside. Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a saucepan. Add the onion; cook and stir until soft. Mix in the parsley, wine, tomatoes, garlic and remaining olive oil. Simmer, stirring occasionally, for about 30 minutes, or until the sauce is thickened. While the sauce is simmering, the prawns should become cool enough to handle. First remove the legs by pinching them, and then pull off the shells, leaving the head and tail on. When the sauce has thickened, stir in the prawns. Bring to a simmer again if the sauce has cooled with the prawns, and cook for about 5 minutes. Add the feta and remove from the heat. Let stand until the cheese starts to melt. Serve warm with slices of crusty bread. Though completely untraditional, you can add a few tablespoons of stock or passata to this recipe to make a delicious pasta sauce. Toss with pasta after adding the feta, and serve.	https://www.themealdb.com/images/media/meals/wuvryu1468232995.jpg	Seafood,Shellfish	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uO0ejc85zSE	2020-10-27 21:11:28	2020-10-27 21:11:28	Raw king prawns	Olive oil	Chopped onion	Freshly chopped parsley	White wine	Chopped tomatoes	Minced garlic	Cubed Feta cheese								null	null	null	null	null	500g	3 tablespoons	1	pinch	250ml	1 (400g) tin	1/2 teaspoon	1 (200g) pack								null	null	null	null	null
103	Grilled Mac and Cheese Sandwich	American	Make the mac and cheese 1. Bring a medium saucepan of generously salted water (you want it to taste like seawater) to a boil. Add the pasta and cook, stirring occasionally, until al dente, 8 to 10 minutes, or according to the package directions. The pasta should be tender but still chewy. 2. While the pasta is cooking, in a small bowl, whisk together the flour, mustard powder, garlic powder, salt, black pepper, and cayenne pepper. 3. Drain the pasta in a colander. Place the empty pasta pan (no need to wash it) over low heat and add the butter. When the butter has melted, whisk in the flour mixture and continue to cook, whisking frequently, until the mixture is beginning to brown and has a pleasant, nutty aroma, about 1 minute. Watch carefully so it does not scorch on the bottom of the pan. 4. Slowly whisk the milk and cream into the flour mixture until everything is really well combined. Cook, whisking constantly, until the sauce is heated through and just begins to thicken, about 2 minutes. Remove from the heat. Gradually add the cheese while stirring constantly with a wooden spoon or silicone spatula and keep stirring until the cheese has melted into the sauce. Then stir in the drained cooked pasta. 5. Line a 9-by-13-inch (23-by-33-centimeter) rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper or aluminum foil. Coat the paper or foil with nonstick cooking spray or slick it with butter. Pour the warm mac and cheese onto the prepared baking sheet and spread it evenly with a spatula. Coat another piece of parchment paper with cooking spray or butter and place it, oiled or buttered side down, directly on the surface of the mac and cheese. Refrigerate until cool and firm, about 1 hour. Make the grilled cheese 6. Heat a large cast-iron or nonstick skillet over medium-low heat. 7. In a small bowl, stir together the 4 tablespoons (55 grams) butter and garlic powder until well blended. 8. Remove the mac and cheese from the refrigerator and peel off the top layer of parchment paper. Carefully cut into 8 equal pieces. Each piece will make 1 grilled mac and cheese sandwich. (You can stash each individual portion in a double layer of resealable plastic bags and refrigerate for up to 3 days or freeze it for up to 1 month.) 9. Spread 3/4 teaspoon garlic butter on one side of each bread slice. Place half of the slices, buttered-side down, on a clean cutting board. Top each with one slice of Cheddar, then 1 piece of the mac and cheese. (Transfer from the baking sheet by scooting your hand or a spatula under each piece of mac and cheese and then flipping it over onto a sandwich.) Place 1 slice of Jack on top of each. Finish with the remaining bread slices, buttered-side up. 10. Using a wide spatula, place as many sandwiches in the pan as will fit without crowding it. Cover and cook until the bottoms are nicely browned, about 4 minutes. Turn and cook until the second sides are browned, the cheese is melted, and the mac and cheese is heated through, about 4 minutes more. 11. Repeat with the remaining ingredients. Cut the sandwiches in half, if desired, and serve.	https://www.themealdb.com/images/media/meals/xutquv1505330523.jpg	null	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYq31xLj-DY	2020-10-27 21:11:28	2020-10-27 21:11:28	Macaroni	Plain Flour	Mustard Powder	Garlic powder	Kosher salt	Black pepper	Cayenne pepper	Butter	Whole Milk	Heavy Cream	Monterey Jack Cheese	Butter	garlic powder	Bread	Cheddar Cheese	Colby Jack Cheese	Butter				8 ounces (230 grams)	1/3 cup	3/4 teaspoon	1/2 teaspoon	1/2 teaspoon	1/2 teaspoon	1/8 teaspoon	6 tablespoons (85 grams)	1 1/2 cups (360 milliliters)	1 cup (240 milliliters)	1 pound (455 grams)	4 tablespoons (55 grams)	1 teaspoon	16 slices square	8 slices mild	8 slices	4 tablespoons (55 grams)

110	Home-made Mandazi	Kenyan	This is one recipe a lot of people have requested and I have tried to make it as simple as possible and I hope it will work for you. Make sure you use the right flour which is basically one with raising agents. Adjust the amount of sugar to your taste and try using different flavours to have variety whenever you have them. You can use Coconut milk instead of regular milk, you can also add desiccated coconut to the dry flour or other spices like powdered cloves or cinnamon. For “healthy looking” mandazis do not roll the dough too thin before frying and use the procedure I have indicated above. 1. Mix the flour,cinnamon and sugar in a suitable bowl. 2. In a separate bowl whisk the egg into the milk 3. Make a well at the centre of the flour and add the milk and egg mixture and slowly mix to form a dough. 4. Knead the dough for 3-4 minutes or until it stops sticking to the sides of the bowl and you have a smooth surface. 5. Cover the dough with a damp cloth and allow to rest for 15 minutes. 6. Roll the dough on a lightly floured surface into a 1cm thick piece. 7. Using a sharp small knife, cut the dough into the desired size setting aside ready for deep frying. 8. Heat your oil in a suitable pot and gently dip the mandazi pieces to cook until light brown on the first side then turn to cook on the second side. 9.

Toss on one side of a baking sheet with a drizzle of oil, salt, and pepper. (For 4 servings, spread potatoes out across entire sheet.) Roast on top rack for 5 minutes (we ll add the broccoli then). 2. Meanwhile, cut broccoli florets into bite-size pieces, if necessary. Peel and finely chop garlic. In a small microwave-safe bowl, combine 1 TBSP olive oil (2 TBSP for 4 servings) and half the garlic. Microwave until garlic sizzles, 30 seconds. 3. Once potatoes have roasted 5 minutes, remove sheet from oven and add broccoli to empty side; carefully toss with garlic oil, salt, and pepper. (For 4 servings, add broccoli to a second sheet.) Continue roasting until potatoes and broccoli are browned and crispy, 15-20 minutes more. 4. While veggies roast, pat chicken dry with paper towels; season all over with salt and pepper. Heat a drizzle of oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Add chicken and cook until browned and cooked through, 5-6 minutes per side. (If chicken browns too quickly, reduce heat to medium.) Turn off heat; set chicken aside to rest. Wash out pan. 5. Heat pan used for chicken over medium-high heat. Add a drizzle of oil and remaining garlic; cook until fragrant, 30 seconds. Stir in vinegar, honey, stock concentrate, and 1/4 cup water (1/3 cup for 4 servings). Simmer until thick and glossy, 2-3 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in 1 TBSP butter (2 TBSP for 4). Season with salt and pepper. 6. Return chicken to pan and turn to coat in glaze. Divide chicken, broccoli, and potatoes between plates. Spoon any remaining glaze over chicken and serve.	https://www.themealdb.com/images/media/meals/kvbotn1581012881.jpg	null		2020-10-27 21:11:28	2020-10-27 21:11:28	Potatoes	Broccoli	Garlic	Chicken Breast	Balsamic Vinegar	Honey	Chicken Stock	Butter	Vegetable Oil	Olive Oil											5	1	2 cloves	2				1 tbsp	1 tbsp	1 tbsp										
112	Honey Yogurt Cheesecake	Greek	Heat oven to 160C/140C fan/gas 3. Crush the biscuits and most of the almonds inside a plastic food bag using a rolling pin. Mix with the butter, then press into the bottom of a deep, oval, 23cm dish (or something similar in size – a roasting tin, baking dish or cake tin will work). Bake for 10 mins until crisp. Stir or mash together the yogurt and mascarpone, then whisk in the eggs, one at a time. Stir in the lemon and orange zests, then stir in most of the honey, reserving about 3 tbsp. Spread over the biscuit base, cover loosely with foil and cook for 1 hr. Remove the foil and cook for 15 mins more until lightly golden and the top is firm with just the slightest wobble in the middle. Leave to cool. Can be kept in the fridge for up to 2 days. To serve, scatter with almonds, drizzle over the remaining honey, and hand around fresh fruit to go with it.	https://www.themealdb.com/images/media/meals/y2irzl1585563479.jpg	null	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JE8crtueXs8	2020-10-27 21:11:28	2020-10-27 21:11:28	Digestive Biscuits	Almonds	Butter	Greek Yogurt	Mascarpone	Eggs	Lemon	Orange	Honey	Fruit Mix											100g	85g	85g	250ml	750g	2	Zest of 1	Zest of 1	250ml	To serve										
113	Irish stew	Irish	Heat the oven to 180C/350F/gas mark 4. Drain and rinse the soaked wheat, put it in a medium pan with lots of water, bring to a boil and simmer for an hour, until cooked. Drain and set aside. Season the lamb with a teaspoon of salt and some black pepper. Put one tablespoon of oil in a large, deep sauté pan for which you have a lid; place on a medium-high heat. Add some of the lamb – don t overcrowd the pan – and sear for four minutes on all sides. Transfer to a bowl, and repeat with the remaining lamb, adding oil as needed. Lower the heat to medium and add a tablespoon of oil to the pan. Add the shallots and fry for four minutes, until caramelised. Tip these into the lamb bowl, and repeat with the remaining vegetables until they are all nice and brown, adding more oil as you need it. Once all the vegetables are seared and removed from the pan, add the wine along with the sugar, herbs, a teaspoon of salt and a good grind of black pepper. Boil on a high heat for about three minutes. Tip the lamb, vegetables and whole wheat back into the pot, and add the stock. Cover and boil for five minutes, then transfer to the oven for an hour and a half. Remove the stew from the oven and check the liquid; if there is a lot, remove the lid and boil for a few minutes.	https://www.themealdb.com/images/media/meals/sxxpst1468569714.jpg	Stew,Meat	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYH2qJXnSMo	2020-10-27 21:11:28	2020-10-27 21:11:28	whole wheat	lamb loin chops	olive oil	shallots	carrots	turnips	celeriac	charlotte potatoes	white wine	caster sugar	fresh thyme	oregano	chicken stock	null	null	null	null	null	null	null	300g soaked overnight in water	2kg cut into 3cm cubes	120ml	24 Skinned	4 large	2	1	350g	150ml	1 tsp	4 sprigs	4 sprigs	450ml			null	null	null	null	null
114	Jam Roly-Poly	British	Put a deep roasting tin onto the bottom shelf of the oven, and make sure that there’s another shelf directly above it. Pull the roasting tin out on its shelf, fill two-thirds with boiling water from the kettle, then carefully slide it back in. Heat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Tear off a large sheet of foil and greaseproof paper (about 30 x 40cm). Sit the greaseproof on top of the foil and butter it. Tip butter, flour and vanilla seeds into a food processor; pulse until the butter has disappeared. Tip into a mixing bowl. Stir through the suet, pour in the milk and work together with a cutlery knife until you get a sticky dough. You may need a drop more milk, depending on your flour. Tip the dough out onto a floured surface, quickly pat together to smooth, then roll out to a square roughly 25 x 25cm. Spread the jam all over, leaving a gap along one edge, then roll up from the opposite edge. Pinch the jam-free edge into the dough where it meets, and pinch the ends roughly, too. Carefully lift onto the greased paper, join-side down (you might find a flat baking sheet helpful for this), loosely bring up the paper and foil around it, then scrunch together along the edges and ends to seal. The roly-poly will puff quite a bit during cooking so don’t wrap it tightly. Lift the parcel directly onto the rack above the tin and cook for 1 hr. Let the pudding sit for 5 mins before unwrapping, then carefully open the foil and paper, and thickly slice to serve.	https://www.themealdb.com/images/media/meals/ysqupp1511640538.jpg	null	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZYWVQ8imVA	2020-10-27 21:11:28	2020-10-27 21:11:28	Butter	Self-raising Flour	Vanilla	Suet	Milk	Raspberry Jam	Custard														50g	250g	1 small	50g	150ml	100g	to serve													
115	Jerk chicken with rice & peas	Jamaican	To make the jerk marinade, combine all the ingredients in a food processor along with 1 tsp salt, and blend to a purée. If you’re having trouble getting it to blend, just keep turning off the blender, stirring the mixture, and trying again. Eventually it will start to blend up – don’t be tempted to add water, as you want a thick paste. Taste the jerk mixture for seasoning – it should taste pretty salty, but not unpleasantly, puckering salty. You can now throw in more chillies if it’s not spicy enough for you. If it tastes too salty and sour, try adding in a bit more brown sugar until the mixture tastes well balanced. Make a few slashes in the chicken thighs and pour the marinade over the meat, rubbing it into all the crevices. Cover and leave to marinate overnight in the fridge. If you want to barbecue your chicken, get the coals burning 1 hr or so before you’re ready to cook. Authentic jerked meats are not exactly grilled as we think of grilling, but sort of smoke-grilled. To get a more authentic jerk experience, add some wood chips to your barbecue, and cook your chicken over slow, indirect heat for 30 mins. To cook in the oven, heat to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Put the chicken pieces in a roasting tin with the lime halves and cook for 45 mins until tender and cooked through. While the chicken is cooking, prepare the rice & peas. Rinse the rice in plenty of cold water, then tip it into a large saucepan with all the remaining ingredients except the kidney beans. Season with salt, add 300ml cold water and set over a high heat. Once the rice begins to boil, turn it down to a medium heat, cover and cook for 10 mins. Add the beans to the rice, then cover with a lid. Leave off the heat for 5 mins until all the liquid is absorbed. Squeeze the roasted lime over the chicken and serve with the rice & peas, and some hot sauce if you like it really spicy.	https://www.themealdb.com/images/media/meals/tytyxu1515363282.jpg	Chilli,Curry	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfchrS2D_v4	2020-10-27 21:11:28	2020-10-27 21:11:28	Chicken Thighs	Lime	Spring Onions	Ginger	Garlic	Onion	Red Chilli	Thyme	Lime	Soy Sauce	Vegetable Oil	Brown Sugar	Allspice	Basmati Rice	Coconut Milk	Spring Onions	Thyme	Garlic	Allspice	Kidney Beans	12	1/2	1 bunch	1 tbs chopped	3 cloves	1/2	3 chopped	1/2 teaspoon	Juice of 1	2 tbs	2 tbs	3 tbs	1 tbs	200g	400g	1 bunch	2 sprigs	2 cloves chopped	1 tbs	800g
116	Jamaican Beef Patties	Jamaican	Make the Pastry Dough To a large bowl, add flour, 1 teaspoon salt, and turmeric and mix thoroughly. Rub shortening into flour until there are small pieces of shortening completely covered with flour. Pour in 1/2 cup of the ice water and mix with your hands to bring the dough together. Keep adding ice water 2 to 3 tablespoons at a time until the mixture forms a dough. At this stage, you can cut the dough into 2 large pieces, wrap in plastic and refrigerate for 30 minutes before using it. Alternatively, cut the dough into 10 to 12 equal pieces, place on a platter or baking sheet, cover securely with plastic wrap and let chill for 30 minutes while you make the filling. Make the Filling Add ground beef to a large bowl. Sprinkle in allspice and black pepper. Mix together and set aside. Heat oil in a skillet until hot. Add onions and sauté until translucent. Add hot pepper, garlic and thyme and continue to sauté for another minute. Add 1/4 teaspoon salt. Add seasoned ground beef and toss to mix, breaking up any clumps, and let cook until the meat is no longer pink. Add ketchup and more salt to taste. Pour in 2 cups of water and stir. Bring the mixture to a boil then reduce heat and let simmer until most of the liquid has evaporated and whatever is remaining has reduced to a thick sauce. Fold in green onions. Remove from heat and let cool completely. Assemble the Patties Beat the egg and water together to make an egg wash. Set aside. Now you can prepare the dough in two ways. First Method: Flour the work surface and rolling pin. If you had cut it into 2 large pieces, then take one of the large pieces and roll it out into a very large circle. Take a bowl with a wide rim (about 5 inches) and cut out three circles. Place about 3 heaping tablespoons of the filling onto 1/2 of each circle. Dip a finger into the water and moisten the edges of the pastry. Fold over the other half and press to seal. Take a fork and crimp the edges. Cut off any extra to make it look neat and uniform. Place on a parchment-lined baking sheet and continue to work until you have rolled all the dough and filled the patties. Second Method: If you had pre-cut the dough into individual pieces, work with one piece of dough at a time. Roll it out on a floured surface into a 5-inch circle or a little larger. Don’t worry if the edges are not perfect. Place 3 heaping tablespoons of the filling on one side of the circle. Dip a finger into the water and moisten the edges of the pastry. Fold over the other half and press to seal. Take a fork and crimp the edges. Cut off any extra to make it look neat and uniform. Place on a parchment-lined baking sheet and continue work until you have rolled all the dough and filled the patties. Frying and Serving the Patties After forming the patties, place the pans in the refrigerator while you heat the oven to 350 F. Just before adding the pans with the patties to the oven, brush the patties with egg wash. Bake patties for 30 minutes or until golden brown. Cool on wire racks. Serve warm.	https://www.themealdb.com/images/media/meals/wsqqsw1515364068.jpg	Snack,Spicy	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypQjoiZiTac	2020-10-27 21:11:28	2020-10-27 21:11:28	Plain Flour	Salt	Curry Powder	Butter	Water	Minced Beef	Allspice	Black Pepper	Vegetable Oil	Onions	Red Pepper	Garlic	Thyme	Salt	Tomato Ketchup	Water	Onions	Egg	Water	Water	4 cups	1 tsp	1 tsp	250g	1 cup	900g	1 tsp	1/2 tsp	2 tbs	1 cup	Ground	2 tsp ground	1 tbs	1/4 tsp	2 tbs	2 cups	1/2 cup	1 beaten	1 tbs	1/4 cup

118	Kentucky Fried Chicken	American	Preheat fryer to 350°F. Thoroughly mix together all the spice mix ingredients. Combine spice mix with flour, brown sugar and salt. Dip chicken pieces in egg white to lightly coat them, then transfer to flour mixture. Turn a few times and make sure the flour mix is really stuck to the chicken. Repeat with all the chicken pieces. Let chicken pieces rest for 5 minutes so crust has a chance to dry a bit. Fry chicken in batches. Breasts and wings should take 12-14 minutes, and legs and thighs will need a few more minutes. Chicken pieces are done when a meat thermometer inserted into the thickest part reads 165°F. Let chicken drain on a few paper towels when it comes out of the fryer. Serve hot.	https://www.themealdb.com/images/media/meals/xqusqy1487348868.jpg	Meat,Spicy	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTUxCvCz8Bc	2020-10-27 21:11:28	2020-10-27 21:11:28	Chicken	Oil	Egg White	Flour	Brown Sugar	Salt	paprika	onion salt	chili powder	black pepper	celery salt	sage	garlic powder	allspice	oregano	basil	marjoram				1 whole	2 quarts neutral frying	1	1 1/2 cups	1 tablespoon	1 tablespoon	1 tablespoon	2 teaspoons	1 teaspoon	1 teaspoon	1/2 teaspoon	1/2 teaspoon	1/2 teaspoon	1/2 teaspoon	1/2 teaspoon	1/2 teaspoon	1/2 teaspoon

Turn doughnuts as they rise to the surface. Fry until golden brown, about 1 minute on each side. Remove carefully from oil (do not prick surface); drain. Dip the doughnuts into creamy glaze set on rack. Glaze: Heat butter until melted. Remove from heat. Stir in powdered sugar and vanilla until smooth.

129	Koshari	Egyptian	Cook the lentils. Bring lentils and 4 cups of water to a boil in a medium pot or saucepan over high heat. Reduce the heat to low and cook until lentils are just tender (15-17 minutes). Drain from water and season with a little salt. (Note: when the lentils are ready, they should not be fully cooked. They should be only par-cooked and still have a bite to them as they need to finish cooking with the rice). Now, for the rice. Drain the rice from its soaking water. Combine the par-cooked lentils and the rice in the saucepan over medium-high heat with 1 tbsp cooking oil, salt, pepper, and coriander. Cook for 3 minutes, stirring regularly. Add warm water to cover the rice and lentil mixture by about 1 1/2 inches (you’ll probably use about 3 cups of water here). Bring to a boil; the water should reduce a bit. Now cover and cook until all the liquid has been absorbed and both the rice and lentils are well cooked through (about 20 minutes). Keep covered and undisturbed for 5 minutes or so. Now make the pasta. While the rice and lentils are cooking, make the pasta according to package instructions by adding the elbow pasta to boiling water with a dash of salt and a little oil. Cook until the pasta is al dente. Drain. Cover the chickpeas and warm in the microwave briefly before serving. Make the crispy onion topping. Sprinkle the onion rings with salt, then toss them in the flour to coat. Shake off excess flour. In a large skillet, heat the cooking oil over medium-high heat, cook the onion rings, stirring often, until they turn a nice caramelized brown. Onions must be crispy, but not burned (15-20 minutes).	https://www.themealdb.com/images/media/meals/4er7mj1598733193.jpg	null	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0d2ZMZBW4Y	2020-10-27 21:11:28	2020-10-27 21:11:28	Brown Lentils	Rice	Coriander	Macaroni	Chickpeas	Onion	Salt	Vegetable Oil													1 1/2 cups	1 1/2 cups	1/2 tsp	2 cups	Can	1 large	Sprinking	1/2 cup												
130	Lamb tomato and sweet spices	Moroccan	Use pickled vine leaves here, preserved in brine. Small delicate leaves are better than the large bristly ones but, if only large leaves are to hand, then trim them to roughly 12 by 12 cms so that you don t get too many layers of leaves around the filling. And remove any stalks. Drain the preserved leaves, immerse them in boiling water for 10 minutes and then leave to dry on a tea towel before use. Basmati rice with butter and pine nuts is an ideal accompaniment. Couscous is great, too. Serves four. First make the filling. Put all the ingredients, apart from the tomatoes, in a bowl. Cut the tomatoes in half, coarsely grate into the bowl and discard the skins. Add half a teaspoon of salt and some black pepper, and stir. Leave on the side, or in the fridge, for up to a day. Before using, gently squeeze with your hands and drain away any juices that come out. To make the sauce, heat the oil in a medium pan. Add the ginger and garlic, cook for a minute or two, taking care not to burn them, then add the tomato, lemon juice and sugar. Season, and simmer for 20 minutes. While the sauce is bubbling away, prepare the vine leaves. Use any torn or broken leaves to line the base of a wide, heavy saucepan. Trim any leaves from the fennel, cut it vertically into 0.5cm-thick slices and spread over the base of the pan to cover completely. Lay a prepared vine leaf (see intro) on a work surface, veiny side up. Put two teaspoons of filling at the base of the leaf in a 2cm-long by 1cm-wide strip. Fold the sides of the leaf over the filling, then roll it tightly from bottom to top, in a cigar shape. Place in the pan, seam down, and repeat with the remaining leaves, placing them tightly next to each other in lines or circles (in two layers if necessary). Pour the sauce over the leaves (and, if needed, add water just to cover). Place a plate on top, to weigh the leaves down, then cover with a lid. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat and cook on a bare simmer for 70 minutes. Most of the liquid should evaporate. Remove from the heat, and leave to cool a little - they are best served warm. When serving, bring to the table in the pan - it looks great. Serve a few vine leaves and fennel slices with warm rice. Spoon the braising juices on top and garnish with coriander.	https://www.themealdb.com/images/media/meals/qtwtss1468572261.jpg		https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaZb1MnFBgA	2020-10-27 21:11:28	2020-10-27 21:11:28	olive oil	ginger	garlic	tomatoes	lemon juice	caster sugar	vine leaves	fennel bulb	lamb mince	onion	potato	basmati rice	chopped parsley	coriander	lemon juice	garlic	clove	cinnamon	tomatoes		2 tbsp	4cm piece finely chopped	2 cloves peeled and chopped	800g peeled and chopped	2 tbsp	1 tsp	50	1 large	400g	1 medium	1 small peeled and coarsely grated	2 tbsp	2 tbsp	2 tbsp chopped	1 tbsp	2 cloves	½ tsp ground	½ tsp ground	2 medium	
131	Lamb Biryani	Indian	Grind the cashew, poppy seeds and cumin seeds into a smooth paste, using as little water as possible. Set aside. Deep fry the sliced onions when it is hot. Don’t overcrowd the oil. When the onions turn light brown, remove from oil and drain on paper towel. The fried onion will crisp up as it drains. Also fry the cashewnuts till golden brown. Set aside. Wash the rice and soak in water for twenty minutes. Meanwhile, take a big wide pan, add oil in medium heat, add the sliced onions, add the blended paste, to it add the green chillies, ginger garlic paste and garlic and fry for a minute. Then add the tomatoes and sauté them well till they are cooked and not mushy. Then to it add the red chilli powder, biryani powder, mint, coriander leaves and sauté them well. Add the yogurt and mix well. I always move the skillet away from the heat when adding yogurt which prevents it from curdling. Now after returning the skillet back to the stove, add the washed lamb and salt and ½ cup water and mix well. Cook for 1 hour and cook it covered in medium low heat or put it in a pressure cooker for 6 whistles. If the water is not drained totally, heat it by keeping it open. Take another big pan, add thrice the cup of rice you use, and boil it. When it is boiling high, add the rice, salt and jeera and mix well. After 7 minutes exact or when the rice is 80% done. Switch off and drain the rice. Now, the layering starts. To the lamb, pat and level it. Add the drained hot rice on the top of it. Garnish with fried onions, ghee, mint, coriander leaves and saffron dissolved in milk. Cover the dish and bake in a 350f oven for 15 minutes or till the cooked but not mushy. Or cook in the stove medium heat for 12 minutes and lowest heat for 5 minutes. And switch off. Mix and serve hot! Notes 1. If you are cooking in oven, do make sure to cook in a big oven safe pan and cover it tight and then keep in oven for the final step. 2. You can skip biryani masala if you don’t have and add just garam masala (1 tsp and red chilli powder – 3 tsp instead of 1 tsp) 3. If it is spicy in the end, squeeze some lemon, it will reduce the heat and enhance the flavors also.	https://www.themealdb.com/images/media/meals/xrttsx1487339558.jpg	Curry,Meat	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7SYVSG5nxo	2020-10-27 21:11:28	2020-10-27 21:11:28	Cashew nuts	Khus khus	Cumin seeds	Onions	Ginger garlic paste	Garlic	Mint	Cilantro	Saffron	Ghee	Basmati rice	Full fat yogurt	Cumin Seeds	Bay leaf	Cinnamon	Cloves	Cardamom	Lamb	Red Chilli powder	Biryani masala	12	½ tbsp	½ tbsp	3 sliced thinly	2 tsp	4 whole	Leaves	Leaves	½ tsp dissolved in ½ cup warm milk	2 tbsp	2 Cups	½ cup	1 tbsp	½	1 thin piece	3	2	1 lb	1 tsp	1 tbsp

Roughly chop the remaining chestnuts. Heat 2 tbsp olive oil in a large non-stick frying pan. Fry the shallots with a pinch of salt until softened, then add the garlic, chopped chestnuts and rosemary, and fry for 2 mins more. Add the wild mushrooms, 2 tbsp oil and some seasoning. Cook for 3 mins until they begin to soften. Drain and roughly chop the dried mushrooms (reserve the soaking liquid), then add those too, along with the soy sauce, and fry for 2 mins more. Whisk the wine, reserved mushroom liquid and chestnut cream together to create a sauce. Season, then add half to the mushroom mixture in the pan and cook for 1 min until the sauce becomes glossy. Remove and discard the rosemary sprigs, then set the mixture aside. Heat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Bring a large pan of salted water to the boil and get a large bowl of ice water ready. Drop the lasagne sheets into the boiling water for 2 mins or until pliable and a little cooked, then immediately plunge them into the cold water. Using your fingers, carefully separate the sheets and transfer to a clean tea towel. Spread a good spoonful of the sauce on the bottom two thirds of each sheet, then, rolling away from yourself, roll up the shorter ends. Cut each roll in half, then position the rolls of pasta cut-side up in a pie dish that you are happy to serve from at the table. If you have any mushroom sauce remaining after you’ve rolled up all the sheets, simply push it into some of the exposed rolls of pasta. Pour the rest of the sauce over the top of the pasta, then bake for 10 mins or until the pasta no longer has any resistance when tested with a skewer. Meanwhile, put the breadcrumbs, the last 2 tbsp olive oil, sage leaves and some seasoning in a bowl, and toss everything together. Scatter the rotolo with the crumbs and sage, then bake for another 10 mins, until the top is golden and the sage leaves are crispy. Leave to cool for 10 mins to allow the pasta to absorb the sauce, then drizzle with a little truffle oil, if you like, before taking your dish to the table.	https://www.themealdb.com/images/media/meals/ssyqwr1511451678.jpg	Vegetarian,Nutty	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNN7_ZSJ5YE	2020-10-27 21:11:28	2020-10-27 21:11:28	Mushrooms	Chestnuts	Challots	Garlic	Rosemary	Wild Mushrooms	Soy Sauce	White Wine	Lasagne Sheets	Breadcrumbs	Sage	Truffle Oil									30g	240g	3	3 cloves	3 sprigs	500g	2 tblsp	125ml	350g	4 tbsp	1/2 handful	to serve

Add the onion and cook for 2-3 minutes, then stir in the tomato purée and cook for 2-3 more minutes. Stir in the flour and cook for a further minute, then add the chopped mushrooms, the stout or beef stock and a couple of dashes of Worcestershire sauce. Bring to the boil, then reduce the heat, cover the pan with a lid and leave to simmer for 20 minutes. Set aside and leave to cool, then turn the meat mixture into a one litre pie dish. Roll out the pastry on a floured work surface until it is slightly larger than the pie dish. Gently drape the pastry over the dish, pressing firmly onto the edges. Trim, then shape the edges into a fluted shape. Cut some leaf shapes out of the pastry trimmings and decorate the top of the pie, sticking them to the pastry with the beaten egg yolk. Make three or four slits in the pastry to allow the steam to escape, then brush the pie with the rest of the beaten egg yolk and bake in the oven for 20-25 minutes, or until golden-brown. To serve, slice into wedges.	https://www.themealdb.com/images/media/meals/xwutvy1511555540.jpg	Pie,Meat	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QY47h-uqq5g	2020-10-27 21:11:28	2020-10-27 21:11:28	Vegetable Oil	Minced Beef	Onion	Tomato Puree	Plain Flour	Mushrooms	Beef Stock	Worcestershire Sauce	Shortcrust Pastry	Egg Yolks											2 tbs	500g	1 chopped	1 tbls	1 ½ tbsp	75g	250ml	Dash	400g	1										
147	McSinghs Scotch pie	British	Heat a large frying pan and toast the cumin seeds for a few minutes, then set aside. Heat the oil in the same pan and fry the onion, garlic, chilli, pepper and a good pinch of salt for around eight minutes, until there is no moisture left. Remove from the heat, stir in the toasted cumin seeds, ground mace (or nutmeg) and ground coriander. Leave to cool. In a large bowl mix together the minced lamb, white pepper, fresh coriander, and the cooled spiced onion mixture until combined. Set aside, covered, in the fridge. Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6 and generously grease a 20cm/8in diameter loose-bottomed or springform round cake tin with lard. To make the pastry, sift the flour and salt in a large bowl and make a well in the centre. Put the milk, lard and 90ml/3fl oz of water in a saucepan and heat gently. When the lard has melted, increase the heat and bring to the boil. Pour the boiling liquid into the flour, and use a wooden spoon to combine until cool enough to handle. Bring together into a ball. Dust a work surface with flour and, working quickly, knead the dough briefly – it will be soft and moist. Set aside a third of the pastry and roll the rest out on a well-floured surface. Line the pie dish with the pastry, pressing it right up the sides until it pokes just over the top of the tin. Add the filling into the pastry-lined tin bit by bit. As you reach the top, form a slight peak. Roll out the reserved pastry and top the pie with it. Pinch the edges to seal and trim the excess. Poke a hole in the top of the pie and insert a small tube made from aluminium foil to allow steam to escape. Brush the top of the pie with a little beaten egg yolk, and bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes (put a tray on the shelf below to catch any drips). Then reduce the temperature to 160C/325F/Gas 3 and cook for a further 1¼ hours until golden-brown. Leave to cool completely before refrigerating for two hours, or overnight. Run a knife around the edge of the pie, remove from the tin and serve with chutneys, salads or pickles.	https://www.themealdb.com/images/media/meals/vssrtx1511557680.jpg	Pie	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nArqhRyszw	2020-10-27 21:11:28	2020-10-27 21:11:28	Cumin	Rapeseed Oil	Red Onions	Garlic Clove	Green Chilli	Red Pepper	Nutmeg	Coriander	Lamb Mince	Pepper	Coriander	Plain Flour	Salt	Milk	Lard	Egg Yolks					2 tsp	1 tbs	2 finely chopped	6	3 finely chopped	1 finely chopped	1 tsp	2 tsp	1kg	1 tsp	3 tbs	340g	½ tsp	90 ml	150g	Beaten				
148	Madeira Cake	British	Pre-heat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4. Grease an 18cm/7in round cake tin, line the base with greaseproof paper and grease the paper. Cream the butter and sugar together in a bowl until pale and fluffy. Beat in the eggs, one at a time, beating the mixture well between each one and adding a tablespoon of the flour with the last egg to prevent the mixture curdling. Sift the flour and gently fold in, with enough milk to give a mixture that falls slowly from the spoon. Fold in the lemon zest. Spoon the mixture into the prepared tin and lightly level the top. Bake on the middle shelf of the oven for 30-40 minutes, or until golden-brown on top and a skewer inserted into the centre comes out clean. Remove from the oven and set aside to cool in the tin for 10 minutes, then turn it out on to a wire rack and leave to cool completely. To serve, decorate the cake with the candied peel.	https://www.themealdb.com/images/media/meals/urtqut1511723591.jpg	Cake,Light,Baking,Desert	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YDh4WEmK_E	2020-10-27 21:11:28	2020-10-27 21:11:28	Butter	Caster Sugar	Eggs	Self-raising Flour	Milk	Lemon	Mixed Peel														175g	175g	3	250g	3 tbs	Zest of 1	To Glaze													
149	Montreal Smoked Meat	Canadian	To make the cure, in a small bowl mix together salt, pink salt, black pepper, coriander, sugar, bay leaf, and cloves. Coat entire brisket with the cure and place in an extra-large resealable plastic bag. Place in the coldest part of the refrigerator and cure for 4 days, flipping brisket twice a day. Remove brisket from bag and wash as much cure off as possible under cold running water. Place brisket in a large container and fill with water and let soak for 2 hours, replacing water every 30 minutes. Remove from water and pat dry with paper towels. To make the rub, mix together black pepper, coriander, paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, dill weed, mustard, celery seed, and crushed red papper in a small bowl. Coat entire brisket with the rub. Fire up smoker or grill to 225 degrees, adding chunks of smoking wood chunks when at temperature. When wood is ignited and producing smoke, place brisket in, fat side up, and smoke until an instant read thermometer registers 165 degrees when inserted into thickest part of the brisket, about 6 hours. Transfer brisket to large roasting pan with V-rack. Place roasting pan over two burners on stovetop and fill with 1-inch of water. Bring water to a boil over high heat, reduce heat to medium, cover roasting pan with aluminum foil, and steam brisket until an instant read thermometer registers 180 degrees when inserted into thickest part of the meat, 1 to 2 hours, adding more hot water as needed. Transfer brisket to cutting board and let cool slightly. Slice and serve, preferably on rye with mustard.	https://www.themealdb.com/images/media/meals/uttupv1511815050.jpg	Speciality,Snack,StrongFlavor	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5oCDoyxbBk	2020-10-27 21:11:28	2020-10-27 21:11:28	Beef Brisket	Salt	Black Pepper	Coriander	Sugar	Bay Leaf	Cloves	Black Pepper	Coriander	Paprika	Garlic	Onion	Dill	English Mustard	Celery Salt	Red Pepper Flakes					1	3 tbs	3 tbs	1 tbs	1 tbs	1 tsp	1 tsp	3 tbs	1 tbs	1 tbs	1 tbs	1 tbs	1 tbs	1 tsp	1 tbs	1 tsp

152	Mince Pies	British	To make the pastry, rub 225g cold, diced butter into 350g plain flour, then mix in 100g golden caster sugar and a pinch of salt. Combine the pastry into a ball – don’t add liquid – and knead it briefly. The dough will be fairly firm, like shortbread dough. You can use the dough immediately, or chill for later. Preheat the oven to 200C/gas 6/fan 180C. Line 18 holes of two 12-hole patty tins, by pressing small walnut-sized balls of pastry into each hole. Spoon 280g mincemeat into the pies. Take slightly smaller balls of pastry than before and pat them out between your hands to make round lids, big enough to cover the pies. Top the pies with their lids, pressing the edges gently together to seal – you don’t need to seal them with milk or egg as they will stick on their own. (The pies may now be frozen for up to 1 month). Beat 1 small egg and brush the tops of the pies. Bake for 20 mins until golden. Leave to cool in the tin for 5 mins, then remove to a wire rack. To serve, lightly dust with icing sugar.	https://www.themealdb.com/images/media/meals/qe8pf51576795532.jpg	Christmas	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnXft7lQNJE	2020-10-27 21:11:28	2020-10-27 21:11:28	Butter	Plain Flour	Caster Sugar	Mincemeat	Egg	Icing Sugar															225g	350g	100g	280g	1 small	Topping

156	New York cheesecake	American	Position an oven shelf in the middle of the oven. Preheat the oven to fan 160C/conventional 180C/gas 4. Line the base of a 23cm springform cake tin with parchment paper. For the crust, melt the butter in a medium pan. Stir in the biscuit crumbs and sugar so the mixture is evenly moistened. Press the mixture into the bottom of the pan and bake for 10 minutes. Cool on a wire rack while preparing the filling. For the filling, increase the oven temperature to fan 200C/conventional 240C/gas 9. In a table top mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat the soft cheese at medium-low speed until creamy, about 2 minutes. With the mixer on low, gradually add the sugar, then the flour and a pinch of salt, scraping down the sides of the bowl and the paddle twice. Swap the paddle attachment for the whisk. Continue by adding the vanilla, lemon zest and juice. Whisk in the eggs and yolk, one at a time, scraping the bowl and whisk at least twice. Stir the 284ml carton of soured cream until smooth, then measure 200ml/7fl oz (just over 3⁄4 of the carton). Continue on low speed as you add the measured soured cream (reserve the rest). Whisk to blend, but don t over-beat. The batter should be smooth, light and somewhat airy. Brush the sides of the springform tin with melted butter and put on a baking sheet. Pour in the filling - if there are any lumps, sink them using a knife - the top should be as smooth as possible. Bake for 10 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to fan 90C/conventional 110C/gas 1⁄4 and bake for 25 minutes more. If you gently shake the tin, the filling should have a slight wobble. Turn off the oven and open the oven door for a cheesecake that s creamy in the centre, or leave it closed if you prefer a drier texture. Let cool in the oven for 2 hours. The cheesecake may get a slight crack on top as it cools. Combine the reserved soured cream with the 142ml carton, the sugar and lemon juice for the topping. Spread over the cheesecake right to the edges. Cover loosely with foil and refrigerate for at least 8 hours or overnight. Run a round-bladed knife around the sides of the tin to loosen any stuck edges. Unlock the side, slide the cheesecake off the bottom of the tin onto a plate, then slide the parchment paper out from underneath.	https://www.themealdb.com/images/media/meals/swttys1511385853.jpg	Desert,Dairy,Pudding,Cake,Breakfast	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tspdJ6hxqnc	2020-10-27 21:11:28	2020-10-27 21:11:28	Butter	Sour Cream	Sugar	Cream Cheese	Caster Sugar	Plain Flour	Lemon Juice	Eggs	Sour Cream	Sour Cream	Caster Sugar	Lemon Juice									85g	140g	1tbsp	900g	250g	3 tbs	1 ½ teaspoons	3 Large	250ml	150ml	1 tbsp	2 tsp

Chill for 10 mins. For the middle layer, make the custard icing; whisk together the butter, cream and custard powder until light and fluffy, then gradually add the icing sugar until fully incorporated. Spread over the bottom layer and chill in the fridge for at least 10 mins until the custard is no longer soft. Melt the chocolate and butter together in the microwave, then spread over the chilled bars and put back in the fridge. Leave until the chocolate has fully set (about 2 hrs).

158	Osso Buco alla Milanese	Italian	Heat the oven to 300 degrees. Dredging the shanks: pour the flour into a shallow dish (a pie plate works nicely). Season the veal shanks on all sides with salt and pepper. One at a time, roll the shanks around in the flour coat, and shake and pat the shank to remove any excuses flour. Discard the remaining flour. Browning the shanks: put the oil and 1 tablespoon of the butter in a wide Dutch oven or heavy braising pot (6 to 7 quart) and heat over medium-high heat. When the butter has melted and the oil is shimmering, lower the shanks into the pot, flat side down; if the shanks won’t fit without touching one another, do this in batches. Brown the shanks, turning once with tongs, until both flat sides are well caramelized, about 5 minutes per side. If the butter-oil mixture starts to burn, lower the heat just a bit. Transfer the shanks to a large platter or tray and set aside. The aromatics: pour off and discard the fat from the pot. Wipe out any burnt bits with a damp paper towel, being careful not to remove any delicious little caramelized bits. Ad the remaining 2 tablespoons butter to the pot and melt it over medium heat. When the butter has stopped foaming, add the onion, carrot, celery, and fennel. Season with salt and pepper, stir, and cook the vegetables until they begin to soften but do not brown, about 6 minutes. Stir in the garlic, orange zest, marjoram, and bay leaf, and stew for another minute or two. The braising liquid: add the wine, increase the heat to high, and bring to a boil. Boil, stirring occasionally, to reduce the wine by about half, 5 minutes. Add the stock and tomatoes, with their juice, and boil again to reduce the liquid to about 1 cup total, about 10 minutes. The braise: Place the shanks in the pot so that they are sitting with the exposed bone facing up, and pour over any juices that accumulated as they sat. Cover with parchment paper, pressing down so the parchment nearly touches the veal and the edges hang over the sides of the pot by about an inch. Cover tightly with the lid, and slide into the lower part of the oven to braise at a gentle simmer. Check the pot after the first 15 minutes, and if the liquid is simmering too aggressively, lower the oven heat by 10 or 15 degrees. Continue braising, turning the shanks and spooning some pan juices over the top after the first 40 minutes, until the meat is completely tender and pulling away from the bone, about 2 hours. The gremolata: While the shanks are braising, stir together the garlic, parsley, and lemon zest in a small bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and set aside in a cool place (or the refrigerator, if your kitchen is very warm.) The finish: When the veal is fork-tender and falling away from the bone, remove the lid and sprinkle over half of the gremolata. Return the veal to the oven, uncovered, for another 15 minutes to caramelize it some. Using a slotted spatula or spoon, carefully lift the shanks from the braising liquid, doing your best to keep them intact. The shanks will be very tender and threatening to fall into pieces, and the marrow will be wobbly inside the bones, so this can be a bit tricky. But if they do break apart, don’t worry, the flavor won’t suffer at all. Arrange the shanks on a serving platter or other large plate, without stacking, and cover with foil to keep warm. Finishing the sauce: Set the braising pot on top of the stove and evaluate the sauce: if there is a visible layer of fat floating on the surface, use a large spoon to skim it off and discard it. Taste the sauce for concentration of flavor. If it tastes a bit weak or flat, bring it to a boil over high heat, and boil to reduce the volume and intensify the flavor for 5 to 10 minutes. Taste again for salt and pepper. If the sauce wants more zip, stir in a teaspoon or two of the remaining gremolata. Portioning the veal shanks: if the shanks are reasonably sized, serve one per person. If the shanks are gargantuan or you’re dealing with modest appetites, pull apart the larger shanks, separating them at their natural seams, and serve smaller amounts. Be sure to give the marrow bones to whomever prizes them most. Serving: Arrange the veal shanks on warm dinner plates accompanied by the risotto, if serving. Just before carrying the plates to the table, sprinkle on the remaining gremolata and then spoon over a generous amount of sauce – the contact with the hot liquid will aromatize the gremolata and perk up everyone’s appetite with the whiff of garlic and lemon.	https://www.themealdb.com/images/media/meals/wwuqvt1487345467.jpg	null	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GUTC2Qwrf0	2020-10-27 21:11:28	2020-10-27 21:11:28	Veal	Flour	Olive Oil	Butter	Onion	Carrot	Celery	Fennel	Garlic	Orange Zest	Marjoram	Bay Leaf	Dry White Wine	Chicken Stock	Tomatoes	Parsley	Garlic	Lemon Zest			4 meaty shanks	½ cup	2 tablespoons	3 tablespoons	1 medium chopped into ½-inch pieces	1 chopped into ½-inch pieces	1 chopped into ½-inch pieces	1 bulb chopped into ½-inch pieces	3 cloves	2 strips	1 ½ teaspoons	1	1 cup	½ cup	1 cup chopped with juice	2 tablespoons chopped	1 teaspoon minced	1 teaspoon grated

161	Potato Gratin with Chicken	Unknown	15 minute potato gratin with chicken and bacon greens: a gratin always seems more effort and more indulgent than ordinary boiled or roasts, but it doesn t have to take 45mins, it s nice for a change and you can control the calorie content by going with full fat to low fat creme fraiche. (It s always tastes better full fat though obviously!) to serve 4: use 800g of potatoes, finely slice and boil in a pan for about 5-8 mins till firmish, not soft. Finely slice 3 onions and place in an oven dish with 2 tblsp of olive oil and 100ml of chicken stock. Cook till the onions are soft then drain the potatoes and pour onto the onions. Season and spoon over cream or creme fraiche till all is covered but not swimming. Grate Parmesan over the top then finish under the grill till nicely golden. serve with chicken and bacon, peas and spinach.	https://www.themealdb.com/images/media/meals/qwrtut1468418027.jpg	null	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3u8eiy3yHI	2020-10-27 21:11:28	2020-10-27 21:11:28	Potatoes	Onions	Olive Oil	Chicken Stock	Creme Fraiche	Parmesan	Chicken Breasts	Bacon	Spinach	Peas						null	null	null	null	null	800g	3	2 tblsp	100ml	1 pot	Topping	4	4	Topping	Topping						null	null	null	null	null

Crush the biscuits by bashing them in a bag with a rolling pin, then stir them into the butter until very well coated. Press the mixture firmly into the base of the tin and chill. Soak the gelatine in water while you make the filling. Tip the ricotta into a bowl, then beat in the peanut butter and syrup. Ricotta has a slightly grainy texture so blitz until smooth with a stick blender for a smoother texture if you prefer. Take the soaked gelatine from the water and squeeze dry. Put it into a pan with the milk and heat very gently until the gelatine dissolves. Beat into the peanut mixture, then tip onto the biscuit base. Chill until set. To freeze, leave in the tin and as soon as it is solid, cover the surface with cling film, then wrap the tin with cling film and foil. To defrost, thaw in the fridge overnight.

Pour the mixture into the tin and bake for 50 mins - 1 hr until the cake feels firm and a little crusty on top. Cool in the tin then wrap in more parchment and foil and keep for 3-5 days before eating if you can – it’ll become softer and stickier the longer you leave it, up to 2 weeks.	https://www.themealdb.com/images/media/meals/qxuqtt1511724269.jpg	Caramel	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1lG4vk2MQA	2020-10-27 21:11:28	2020-10-27 21:11:28	Butter	Egg	Milk	Golden Syrup	Black Treacle	Brown Sugar	Oatmeal	Self-raising Flour	Ground Ginger												200g	1 large	4 tbs	200g	85g	85g	100g	250g	1 tbs											
170	Pear Tarte Tatin	French	Core the pears, then peel as neatly as possible and halve. If you like, they can be prepared up to a day ahead and kept in the fridge, uncovered, so that they dry out. Tip the sugar, butter, star anise, cardamom and cinnamon into an ovenproof frying pan, about 20cm wide, and place over a high heat until bubbling. Shake the pan and stir the buttery sauce until it separates and the sugar caramelises to a toffee colour. Lay the pears in the pan, then cook in the sauce for 10-12 mins, tossing occasionally, until completely caramelised. Don’t worry about them burning – they won’t – but you want to caramelise them as much as possible. Splash in the brandy and let it flambé, then set the pears aside. Heat oven to 200C/fan 180C/gas 6. Roll the pastry out to the thickness of a £1 coin. Using a plate slightly larger than the top of the pan, cut out a circle, then press the edges of the circle of pastry to thin them out. When the pears have cooled slightly, arrange them in the pan, cut side up, in a floral shape, with the pears around the edge pointing inwards. Rest the cinnamon stick on the top in the centre, with the cardamom pods scattered around. Drape the pastry over the pears, then tuck the edges down the pan sides and under the fruit (see Gordon’s guide). Pierce the pastry a few times, then bake for 15 mins. If a lot of juice bubbles up the side of the pan, pour it off at this stage (see guide). Reduce oven to 180C/fan 160C/gas 4 and bake for 15 mins more until the pastry is golden. Leave the tart to stand for 10 mins, then invert it carefully onto a serving dish.	https://www.themealdb.com/images/media/meals/rxvxrr1511797671.jpg	Tart,Glazed,Baking	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8U1tKWKDeWA	2020-10-27 21:11:28	2020-10-27 21:11:28	Pears	Caster Sugar	Butter	Star Anise	Cardamom	Cinnamon	Brandy	Puff Pastry													8	100g	100g	2	3 Pods	1 large	2 tbs	500g												
171	Provençal Omelette Cake	French	Break the eggs into two bowls, five in each. Whisk lightly and season with salt and pepper. Heat the oil in a pan, add the courgettes and spring onions, then fry gently for about 10 mins until softened. Cool, then stir into one bowl of eggs with a little salt and pepper. Add the roasted peppers to the other bowl of eggs with the garlic, chilli, salt and pepper. Heat a little oil in a 20-23cm frying pan, preferably non-stick. Pour the eggs with courgette into a measuring jug, then pourabout one-third of the mixture into the pan, swirling it to cover the base of the pan. Cook until the egg is set and lightly browned underneath, then cover the pan with a plate and invert the omelette onto it. Slide it back into the pan to cook the other side. Repeat with the remaining mix to make two more omelettes, adding a little oil to the pan each time. Stack the omelettes onto a plate. Make three omelettes in the same way with the red pepper mixture, then stack them on a separate plate. Now make the filling. Beat the cheese to soften it, then beat in the milk to make a spreadable consistency. Stir in the herbs, salt and pepper. Line a deep, 20-23cm round cake tin with cling film (use a tin the same size as the frying pan). Select the best red pepper omelette and place in the tin, prettiest side down. Spread with a thin layer of cheese filling, then cover with a courgette omelette. Repeat, alternating the layers, until all the omelettes and filling are in the tin, finishing with an omelette. Flip the cling film over the omelette, then chill for up to 24 hrs. To serve, invert the omelette cake onto a serving plate and peel off the cling film. Pile rocket on the top and scatter over the cheese, a drizzle of olive oil and a little freshly ground black pepper. Serve cut into wedges.	https://www.themealdb.com/images/media/meals/qwtrtp1511799242.jpg	Egg	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7isFo2uP2k	2020-10-27 21:11:28	2020-10-27 21:11:28	Eggs	Olive Oil	Courgettes	Spring Onions	Red Pepper	Garlic Clove	Red Chilli	Cream Cheese	Milk	Chives	Basil	Rocket	Parmesan								10	1 tbs	2 finely chopped	3 finely chopped	4	1 clove peeled crushed	1	300g	6 tblsp	4 tbs	2 tbs	to serve	to serve							
172	Prawn & Fennel Bisque	French	Shell the prawns, then fry the shells in the oil in a large pan for about 5 mins. Add the onion, fennel and carrots and cook for about 10 mins until the veg start to soften. Pour in the wine and brandy, bubble hard for about 1 min to drive off the alcohol, then add the tomatoes, stock and paprika. Cover and simmer for 30 mins. Meanwhile, chop the prawns. Blitz the soup as finely as you can with a stick blender or food processor, then press through a sieve into a bowl. Spend a bit of time really working the mixture through the sieve as this will give the soup its velvety texture. Tip back into a clean pan, add the prawns and cook for 10 mins, then blitz again until smooth. You can make and chill this a day ahead or freeze it for 1 month. Thaw ovenight in the fridge. To serve, gently reheat in a pan with the cream. If garnishing, cook the 8 prawns in a little butter. Spoon into small bowls and top with the prawns and snipped fennel fronds.	https://www.themealdb.com/images/media/meals/rtwwvv1511799504.jpg	Soup,Warm,Seafood,Shellfish	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4thpMbDakgM	2020-10-27 21:11:28	2020-10-27 21:11:28	Tiger Prawns	Olive Oil	Onion	Fennel	Carrots	Dry White Wine	Brandy	Chopped Tomatoes	Fish Stock	Paprika	Double Cream	Prawns									450g	4 tbs	1 large	1 large	2 chopped	150ml	1 tbs	400g	1L	2 pinches	150ml	8

177	Paszteciki (Polish Pasties)	Polish	Sift flour and salt into a large mixing bowl. Use a spoon to push the egg yolk through a fine sieve into the flour. Add the raw egg and mix well. Beat in butter 1 tablespoon at a time. Place dough on a floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, then wrap in waxed paper and refrigerate until firm (at least 30 minutes). In a heavy skillet, melt 2 tablespoons butter over medium heat; saute the onion and rutabaga until the onion is soft and transparent (5 minutes). Put the onions, rutabaga, and beef through a meat grinder twice if you have one, if not just chop them up as fine as possible. Melt the remaining 4 tablespoons butter over medium heat, and add the meat mixture. Cook over low heat, stirring occasionally, until all of the liquid has evaporated and the mixture is thick enough to hold its shape. Remove from heat and let cool, then stir in 1 egg, and season with salt and pepper. Preheat oven to 350°F. On a lightly floured surface, roll the dough out into a 13x8 rectangle (1/8 thick). Spoon the filling down the center of the rectangle lengthwise, leaving about an inch of space on each end. Lightly brush the long sides with cold water, then fold one of the long sides over the filling and the other side over the top of that. Brush the short ends with cold water and fold them over the top, enclosing the filling. Place pastry seam side down on a baking sheet and brush the top evenly with the remaining scrambled egg. Bake in preheated oven until rich golden brown (30 minutes).

Transfer the sausages to a plate, then add the onion and fennel to the hot pan and fry for 15 minutes, stirring once in a while, until soft and caramelised; if the pan goes a bit dry, add a teaspoon or so of extra oil. Stir in the paprika, garlic and half the fennel seeds, fry for two minutes more, then pour on the wine and boil for 30 seconds, to reduce by half. Add the tomatoes, sugar, 100ml water, the seared sausage and half a teaspoon of salt, cover and simmer for 30 minutes; remove the lid after 10 minutes, and cook until the sauce is thick and rich. Remove from the heat, stir through the olives and remaining fennel seeds and set aside until you’re ready to serve. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil, add the pasta and cook for 12-14 minutes (or according to the instructions on the packet), until al dente. Meanwhile, reheat the sauce. Drain the pasta, return it to the pot, stir in a tablespoon of oil, then divide between the bowls. Put all the pesto ingredients except the basil in the small bowl of a food processor. Add a tablespoon of water and blitz to a rough paste. Add the basil, then blitz until just combined (the pesto has a much better texture if the basil is not overblended). Spoon over the ragù and top with a spoonful of pesto. Finish with a sprinkling of chopped fennel fronds, if you have any, and serve at once.	https://www.themealdb.com/images/media/meals/qtqvys1468573168.jpg	Pasta	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45dpOfESxr8	2020-10-27 21:11:28	2020-10-27 21:11:28	olive oil	Italian fennel sausages	onion	fennel bulb	smoky paprika	garlic	fennel seeds	red wine	chopped tomatoes	caster sugar	pitted black olives	rigatoni	pecorino	anchovy fillet	garlic	olive oil	basil leaves				2½ tbsp	6 cut into 1.5cm-thick slices	1 large peeled and chopped	1 trimmed and roughly chopped	 reserve any fronds to garnish	½ tsp	1 clove, peeled and sliced	2 tsp lightly toasted and then gently crushed	100ml	400g tinned	½ tsp	50g cut in half lengthways	500g	30g roughly crumbled into 0.5cm pieces	1 rinsed and patted dry	1 clove, peeled and crushed	60ml	50g torn		
181	Rocky Road Fudge	American	Line an 8-inch-square baking pan with wax paper or foil, and coat with non-stick spray. Pour ½ cup of the miniature marshmallows into the bottom of the lined baking dish. In a microwave-safe bowl, combine the chocolate chips and peanut butter. Microwave the chocolate mixture in 20-second intervals, stirring in between each interval, until the chocolate is melted. Add the vanilla extract and stir well, until smooth. Reserve 2 tablespoons of the chopped almonds or peanuts, and set aside. Fold 1 ½ cups of the miniature marshmallows and the remaining chopped nuts into the chocolate mixture. Transfer the chocolate mixture into the prepared pan and spread into an even layer. Immediately top with the reserved chopped nuts and the mallow bits or additional miniature marshmallows, if using. Refrigerate for 4 hours, or until set. Remove the fudge and wax paper from the pan. Carefully peel all of wax paper from the fudge. Cut the fudge into bite-sized pieces and serve.	https://www.themealdb.com/images/media/meals/vtxyxv1483567157.jpg	Chocolate,Snack,Sweet,Baking	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N1aJ3nEYXyg	2020-10-27 21:11:28	2020-10-27 21:11:28	Miniature Marshmallows	Chocolate Chips	Peanut Butter	Vanilla Extract	Peanuts																2 cups	3 cups	½ cup	1 tsp	1 ¼ cups															
182	Recheado Masala Fish	Indian	Soak all the spices, ginger, garlic, tamarind pulp and kashmiri chilies except oil in vinegar. Add sugar and salt. Also add turmeric powder. Combine all nicely and marinate for 35-40 mins. Grind the mixture until soft and smooth. Add more vinegar if required but ensure the paste has to be thick so add vinegar accordingly. If the masala paste is thin then it would not stick to the fish. Rinse the fish slit from the center and give some incision from the top. You could see the fish below for clarity. Now stuff the paste into the center and into the incision. Coat the entire fish with this paste. Marinate the fish for 30 mins. Place oil in a shallow pan, once oil is quite hot shallow fry the stuffed mackerels. Fry until golden brown from both sides Serve the recheado mackerels hot with salad, lime wedges, rice and curry. Notes 1. Ensure the masala paste is thick else the result won t be good. 2. If you aren t able to find kashmiri chilies then use bedgi chilies or kashmiri red chili powder. 3. You could use white vinegar or coconut vinegar. 4. Any left over paste could be stored in the fridge for future use. 5. Cinnamon could be avoided as it s a strong spice used generally for meat or chicken.	https://www.themealdb.com/images/media/meals/uwxusv1487344500.jpg	Fish,Spicy	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXtCris37nE	2020-10-27 21:11:28	2020-10-27 21:11:28	Mackerel	Red Chili	Ginger	Garlic	Pepper	Cumin	Turmeric	Cinnamon stick	Clove	Cardamom	Sugar	Tamarind ball	Vinegar	Oil							4	18 dried	1 inch	8 cloves	1.5 tsp	1 tsp	½ tsp		4	2	1 tbsp	2 marble sized	2.5 tbsp	for frying						
183	Ribollita	Italian	Put 2 tablespoons of the oil in a large pot over medium heat. When it’s hot, add onion, carrot, celery and garlic; sprinkle with salt and pepper and cook, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are soft, 5 to 10 minutes. Heat the oven to 500 degrees. Drain the beans; if they’re canned, rinse them as well. Add them to the pot along with tomatoes and their juices and stock, rosemary and thyme. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat so the soup bubbles steadily; cover and cook, stirring once or twice to break up the tomatoes, until the flavors meld, 15 to 20 minutes. Fish out and discard rosemary and thyme stems, if you like, and stir in kale. Taste and adjust seasoning. Lay bread slices on top of the stew so they cover the top and overlap as little as possible. Scatter red onion slices over the top, drizzle with the remaining 3 tablespoons oil and sprinkle with Parmesan. Put the pot in the oven and bake until the bread, onions and cheese are browned and crisp, 10 to 15 minutes. (If your pot fits under the broiler, you can also brown the top there.) Divide the soup and bread among 4 bowls and serve.	https://www.themealdb.com/images/media/meals/xrrwpx1487347049.jpg	Vegetarian	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BiQUYTBb6eQ	2020-10-27 21:11:28	2020-10-27 21:11:28	Olive Oil	Onion	Carrot	Celery	Garlic	Cannellini Beans	Canned tomatoes	Water	Rosemary	Thyme	Kale	Wholegrain Bread	Red Onion	Parmesan							5 tablespoons	1 chopped	1 chopped	1 stalk chopped	1 tablespoon minced	2 cups	1	4 cups	1 fresh sprig	1 fresh sprig	1 pound chopped	4 thick slices	1 thinly sliced	½ cup freshly grated						
184	Roasted Eggplant With Tahini, Pine Nuts, and Lentils	American	For the Lentils: Adjust oven rack to center position and preheat oven to 450°F to prepare for roasting eggplant. Meanwhile, heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat until shimmering. Add carrots, celery, and onion and cook, stirring, until softened but not browned, about 4 minutes. Add garlic and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add lentils, bay leaves, stock or water, and a pinch of salt. Bring to a simmer, cover with the lid partially ajar, and cook until lentils are tender, about 30 minutes. (Top up with water if lentils are at any point not fully submerged.) Remove lid, stir in vinegar, and reduce until lentils are moist but not soupy. Season to taste with salt and pepper, cover, and keep warm until ready to serve. 2. For the Eggplant: While lentils cook, cut each eggplant in half. Score flesh with the tip of a paring knife in a cross-hatch pattern at 1-inch intervals. Transfer to a foil-lined rimmed baking sheet, cut side up, and brush each eggplant half with 1 tablespoon oil, letting each brushstroke be fully absorbed before brushing with more. Season with salt and pepper. Place a rosemary sprig on top of each one. Transfer to oven and roast until completely tender and well charred, 25 to 35 minutes. Remove from oven and discard rosemary. 3. To Serve: Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil and pine nuts in a medium skillet set over medium heat. Cook, tossing nuts frequently, until golden brown and aromatic, about 4 minutes. Transfer to a bowl to halt cooking. Stir half of parsley and rosemary into lentils and transfer to a serving platter. Arrange eggplant halves on top. Spread a few tablespoons of tahini sauce over each eggplant half and sprinkle with pine nuts. Sprinkle with remaining parsley and rosemary, drizzle with additional olive oil, and serve.	https://www.themealdb.com/images/media/meals/ysqrus1487425681.jpg	Vegetarian,Pulse,Nutty	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkywCtna9t0	2020-10-27 21:11:28	2020-10-27 21:11:28	Olive Oil	Carrots	Celery	Onion	Garlic	Brown Lentils	Bay Leaves	Water	Salt	Apple Cider Vinegar	Pepper	Egg Plants	Rosemary	Pine nuts	Parsley						2 tablespoons	2 small cut into chunks	2 small stalks	1 medium finely diced	6 medium cloves sliced	12 ounces (340g)	2	4 cups	Pinch	2 teaspoons (10ml)	Pinch	2 large	4 sprigs	1/4 cup	2 tablespoons					
185	Rock Cakes	British	Preheat oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4 and line a baking tray with baking parchment. Mix the flour, sugar and baking powder in a bowl and rub in the cubed butter until the mixture looks like breadcrumbs, then mix in the dried fruit. In a clean bowl, beat the egg and milk together with the vanilla extract. Add the egg mixture to the dry ingredients and stir with a spoon until the mixture just comes together as a thick, lumpy dough. Add a teaspoon more milk if you really need it to make the mixture stick together. Place golfball-sized spoons of the mixture onto the prepared baking tray. Leave space between them as they will flatten and spread out to double their size during baking. Bake for 15-20 minutes, until golden-brown. Remove from the oven, allow to cool for a couple of minutes then turn them out onto a wire rack to cool.	https://www.themealdb.com/images/media/meals/tqrrsq1511723764.jpg	Baking,Cake	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tY3taZO3Aro	2020-10-27 21:11:28	2020-10-27 21:11:28	Self-raising Flour	Caster Sugar	Baking Powder	Butter	Dried Fruit	Eggs	Milk	Vanilla Extract													225g	75g	1 tsp	125g	150g	1	1 tbs	2 tsp												
225	Strawberry Rhubarb Pie	British	Pie Crust: In a food processor, place the flour, salt, and sugar and process until combined. Add the butter and process until the mixture resembles coarse meal (about 15 seconds). Pour 1/4 cup (60 ml) water in a slow, steady stream, through the feed tube until the dough just holds together when pinched. If necessary, add more water. Do not process more than 30 seconds. Turn the dough onto your work surface and gather into a ball. Divide the dough in half, flattening each half into a disk, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for about one hour before using. This will chill the butter and relax the gluten in the flour. After the dough has chilled sufficiently, remove one portion of the dough from the fridge and place it on a lightly floured surface. Roll the pastry into a 12 inch (30 cm) circle. (To prevent the pastry from sticking to the counter and to ensure uniform thickness, keep lifting up and turning the pastry a quarter turn as you roll (always roll from the center of the pastry outwards).) Fold the dough in half and gently transfer to a 9 inch (23 cm) pie pan. Brush off any excess flour and trim any overhanging pastry to an edge of 1/2 inch (1.5 cm). Refrigerate the pastry, covered with plastic wrap, while you make the filling. Remove the second round of pastry and roll it into a 13 inch (30 cm) circle. Using a pastry wheel or pizza cutter, cut the pastry into about 3/4 inch (2 cm) strips. Place the strips of pastry on a parchment paper-lined baking sheet, cover with plastic wrap, and place in the refrigerator for about 10 minutes. Make the Strawberry Rhubarb Filling: Place the cut strawberries and rhubarb in a large bowl. In a small bowl mix together the cornstarch, sugar, and ground cinnamon. Remove the chilled pie crust from the fridge. Sprinkle about 2 tablespoons of the sugar mixture over the bottom of the pastry crust. Add the remaining sugar mixture to the strawberries and rhubarb and gently toss to combine. Pour the fruit mixture into the prepared pie shell. Sprinkle the fruit with about 1 teaspoon of lemon juice and dot with 2 tablespoons of butter. Remove the lattice pastry from the refrigerator and, starting at the center with the longest strips and working outwards, place half the strips, spacing about 1 inch (2.5 cm) apart, on top of the filling. (Use the shortest pastry strips at the outer edges.) Then, gently fold back, about halfway, every other strip of pastry. Take another strip of pastry and place it perpendicular on top of the first strips of pastry. Unfold the bottom strips of pastry and then fold back the strips that weren t folded back the first time. Lay another strip of pastry perpendicular on top of the filling and then continue with the remaining strips. Trim the edges of the pastry strips, leaving a 1 inch (2.5 cm) overhang. Seal the edges of the pastry strips by folding them under the bottom pastry crust and flute the edges of the pastry. Brush the lattice pastry with milk and sprinkle with a little sugar. Cover and place in the refrigerator while you preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (205 degrees C) and place the oven rack in the lower third of the oven. Put a baking sheet, lined with aluminum foil, on the oven rack (to catch any spills.) Place the pie plate on the hot baking sheet and bake the pie for about 35 minutes and then, if the edges of the pie are browning too much, cover with a foil ring. Continue to bake the pie for about another 10 minutes or until the crust is a golden brown color and the fruit juices begin to bubble. Remove the pie from the oven and place on a wire rack to cool for several hours. Serve at room temperature with softly whipped cream or vanilla ice cream. Leftovers can be stored in the refrigerator for about 3 days. Reheat before serving. This pie can be frozen. Makes one 9 inch (23 cm) pie.	https://www.themealdb.com/images/media/meals/178z5o1585514569.jpg	Pudding,Pie,Baking,Fruity,Glazed	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGw5Pwm4YA0	2020-10-27 21:11:28	2020-10-27 21:11:28	Flour	Salt	Sugar	Butter	Water	Rhubarb	Strawberries	Cornstarch	Sugar	Cinnamon	Lemon Juice	Unsalted Butter	Milk	Sugar							350g	1 tsp	2 tbs	1 cup	1/2 cup	450g	450g	3 tbs	150g	1/4 tsp	1 tsp	2 tbs	2 tbs	Spinkling						
186	Ratatouille	French	Cut the aubergines in half lengthways. Place them on the board, cut side down, slice in half lengthways again and then across into 1.5cm chunks. Cut off the courgettes ends, then across into 1.5cm slices. Peel the peppers from stalk to bottom. Hold upright, cut around the stalk, then cut into 3 pieces. Cut away any membrane, then chop into bite-size chunks. Score a small cross on the base of each tomato, then put them into a heatproof bowl. Pour boiling water over the tomatoes, leave for 20 secs, then remove. Pour the water away, replace the tomatoes and cover with cold water. Leave to cool, then peel the skin away. Quarter the tomatoes, scrape away the seeds with a spoon, then roughly chop the flesh. Set a sauté pan over medium heat and when hot, pour in 2 tbsp olive oil. Brown the aubergines for 5 mins on each side until the pieces are soft. Set them aside and fry the courgettes in another tbsp oil for 5 mins, until golden on both sides. Repeat with the peppers. Don’t overcook the vegetables at this stage, as they have some more cooking left in the next step. Tear up the basil leaves and set aside. Cook the onion in the pan for 5 mins. Add the garlic and fry for a further min. Stir in the vinegar and sugar, then tip in the tomatoes and half the basil. Return the vegetables to the pan with some salt and pepper and cook for 5 mins. Serve with basil.	https://www.themealdb.com/images/media/meals/wrpwuu1511786491.jpg	Vegetables,SideDish	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFdQUgAFtGU	2020-10-27 21:11:28	2020-10-27 21:11:28	Aubergine	Courgettes	Yellow Pepper	Tomato	Olive Oil	Basil	Onion	Garlic Clove	Red Wine Vinegar	Sugar											2 large	4	2	4 large	5 tbs	Bunch	1 medium	3 finely chopped	1 tsp	1 tsp

Cook and stir until onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Reduce heat to low and continue to cook and stir until onion is very tender and dark brown, about 40 minutes more. Bring chicken broth to a boil in a large pot; stir in chicken breasts, reduce heat, and simmer until chicken is no longer pink at the center, about 20 minutes. Remove from heat. Remove chicken breasts to a plate using a slotted spoon; reserve broth. Juice potatoes with an electric juicer; place dry potato flesh into a bowl and discard juice. Stir salt and pepper into potatoes; stir in enough reserved broth to make the mixture the consistency of oatmeal. Set remaining broth aside. Spread half of potato mixture evenly into the prepared pan. Lay cooked chicken breast evenly over potatoes; scatter caramelized onion evenly over chicken. Spread remaining potato mixture over onions and chicken to cover. Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 1 hour. Reheat chicken broth; pour over individual servings as desired.	https://www.themealdb.com/images/media/meals/ruwpww1511817242.jpg	Pie	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ys2kZnTVXAM	2020-10-27 21:11:28	2020-10-27 21:11:28	Butter	Onions	Chicken Stock	Chicken Breast	Potatoes	Salt	Black Pepper														2 tbs	2 chopped	4 qt	1.5kg	4kg	2 tbs	1tbsp													
188	Red Peas Soup	Jamaican	Wash and rinse the dried kidney beans.. then cover with water in a deep bowl. Remember as they soak they will expand to at least triple the size they were originally so add a lot of water to the bowl. Soak them overnight or for at least 2 hrs to make the cooking step go quicker. I tossed out the water they were soaked in after it did the job. Have your butcher cut the salted pigtail into 2 inch pieces as it will be very difficult to cut with an ordinary kitchen knife. Wash, then place a deep pot with water and bring to a boil. Cook for 20 minutes, then drain + rinse and repeat (boil again in water). The goal is to make the pieces of pig tails tender and to remove most of the salt it was cured in. Time to start the soup. Place everything in the pot (except the flour and potato), then cover with water and place on a high flame to bring to a boil. As it comes to a boil, skim off any scum/froth at the top and discard. Reduce the heat to a gentle boil and allow it to cook for 1 hr and 15 mins.. basically until the beans are tender and start falling apart. It’s now time to add the potato (and Yams etc if you’re adding it) as well as the coconut milk and continue cooking for 15 minutes. Now is a good time to start making the basic dough for the spinner dumplings. Mix the flour and water (add a pinch of salt if you want) until you have a soft/smooth dough. allow it to rest for 5 minutes, then pinch of a tablespoon at a time and roll between your hands to form a cigarette shape. Add them to the pot, stir well and continue cooking for another 15 minutes on a rolling boil. You’ll notice that I didn’t add any salt to the pot as the remaining salt from the salted pigtails will be enough to properly season this dish. However you can taste and adjust accordingly. Lets recap the timing part of things so you’re not confused. Cook the base of the soup for 1 hr and 15 minute or until tender, then add the potatoes and cook for 15 minutes, then add the dumplings and cook for a further 15 minutes. Keep in mind that this soup will thicken quite a bit as it cools. While this is not a traditional recipe to any one specific island, versions of this soup (sometimes called stewed peas) can be found throughout the Caribbean, Latin America and Africa. A hearty bowl of this soup will surely give you the sleepies (some may call it ethnic fatigue). You can certainly freeze the leftovers and heat it up another day.	https://www.themealdb.com/images/media/meals/sqpqtp1515365614.jpg	Soup,SideDish	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ogCfDXotMw	2020-10-27 21:11:28	2020-10-27 21:11:28	Kidney Beans	Carrots	Spring Onions	Thyme	Onion	Black Pepper	Red Pepper	Garlic Clove	Allspice	Beef	Water	Potatoes	Plain Flour	Water	Coconut Milk						2 cups	1 large	2 chopped	4 sprigs	1 Diced	1/2 tsp	2 chopped	4 Mashed	1 tbs	2 Lbs	2L	4	1 cup	1/4 cup	1 cup

Add a glug of olive oil, season with salt and pepper and toss around to coat the veggies in the oil. Roast in the oven for 20 minutes, turning a couple of times until the veg are pretty much cooked through and turning golden. 2 Meanwhile, heat a paella pan or large frying pan over a low– medium heat and add a glug of olive oil. Sauté the onion for 8–10 minutes until softened. Increase the heat to medium and stir in the rice, paprika and saffron. Cook for around 1 minute to start toasting the rice, then add the white wine. Reduce by about half before stirring in two-thirds of the stock. Reduce to a simmer and cook for 10 minutes without a lid, stirring a couple of times. 3 Stir in the peas, add some seasoning, then gently mix in the roasted veg. Pour over the remaining stock, arrange the lemon wedges on top and cover with a lid or some aluminium foil. Cook for a further 10 minutes. 4 To ensure you get the classic layer of toasted rice at the bottom of the pan, increase the heat to high until you hear a slight crackle. Remove from the heat and sit for 5 minutes before sprinkling over the parsley and serving.	https://www.themealdb.com/images/media/meals/1520081754.jpg	Vegan,Paella	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5SmjR-fxUs	2020-10-27 21:11:28	2020-10-27 21:11:28	Baby Aubergine	Fennel	Red Pepper	Courgettes	Onion	Paella Rice	Paprika	Saffron	White Wine	Vegetable Stock	Frozen Peas	Lemon	Parsley	Salt	Black Pepper						6 small	4 small	1 thinly sliced	1 medium	1 finely chopped	300g	1 tsp	pinch	200ml	700ml	100g	1 chopped	Handful	pinch	pinch

When the mixture will not be mixing well, and will look like wood chips, put away the blending mixer and using your hands knead the dough. Create a roll and cover in foil and freeze for 15 minutes. At this time preheat the oven to 375. Take the dough out and separate into two. Roll and cut out 3 inch trangles. Make as many as you can and on centre of each put a small spoon of jam. Roll them into a croissant shape. Place the croissants onto a greased cookie sheet, and bake for 10-12 minutes or until golden. Repeat with the rest of the dough. When you take them out, put aside and sprinkle with powdered sugar on top. This makes about 3 batches of 20 cookies each.

194	Smoky Lentil Chili with Squash	British	Begin by roasting the squash. Slice it into thin crescents and drizzle with a little oil and sprinkle with sea salt. I added a fresh little sage I had in the fridge, but it’s unnecessary. Roast the squash a 205 C (400 F) for 20-30 minutes, flipping halfway through, until soft and golden. Let cool and chop into cubes. Meanwhile, rinse the lentils and cover them with water. Bring them to the boil then turn down to a simmer and let cook (uncovered) for 20-30 minutes, or until tender. Drain and set aside. While the lentils are cooking heat the 1 Tbsp. of oil on low in a medium pot. Add the onions and leeks and sauté for 5 or so minutes, or until they begin to soften. Add the garlic next along with the cumin and coriander, cooking for a few more minutes. Add the remaining spices – paprika, cinnamon, chilli, cocoa, Worcestershire sauce, salt, and oregano. Next add the can of tomatoes, the water or stock, and carrots. Let simmer, covered, for 20 minutes or until the veg is tender and the mixture has thickened up. You’ll need to check on the pot periodically for a stir and a top of of liquid if needed. Add the lentils and chopped roasted squash. Let cook for 10 more minutes to heat through. Serve with sliced jalapeno, lime wedges, cilantro, green onions, and cashew sour cream. SIMPLE CASHEW SOUR CREAM 1 Cup Raw Unsalted Cashews Pinch Sea Salt 1 tsp.

Alternatively, you can use cold water and let the cashews soak overnight, but I’m forgetful/lazy, so often use the boil method which is much faster. After the cashews have soaked, drain them and add to a high speed blender. Begin to puree, slowly adding about 1/2 cup fresh water, until a creamy consistency is reached. You may need to add less or more water to reach the desired consistency. Add a pinch of sea salt and vinegar (or lemon juice).	https://www.themealdb.com/images/media/meals/uwxqwy1483389553.jpg	Pulse	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKmqawK2Tqs	2020-10-27 21:11:28	2020-10-27 21:11:28	Olive Oil	Onion	Leek	Garlic	Cumin	Coriander	Smoked Paprika	Cinnamon	Chili Powder	Cocoa	Dried Oregano	Diced Tomatoes	Water	Carrots	Brown Lentils	Sea Salt	Squash	Cashews	Apple Cider Vinegar		1 tbls	1	1 chopped	3 cloves	4 tsp ground	2 tsp ground	1 tsp	1/2 tsp	1 tsp	1 tsp	1/2 tsp	1 can	3 cups	3 chopped	1 1/2 cups	1 tsp	1 Small	1 Cup	1 tsp	
195	Sticky Toffee Pudding Ultimate	British	Stone and chop the dates quite small, put them in a bowl, then pour the boiling water over. Leave for about 30 mins until cool and well-soaked, then mash a bit with a fork. Stir in the vanilla extract. Butter and flour seven mini pudding tins (each about 200ml/7fl oz) and sit them on a baking sheet. Heat oven to 180C/fan 160C/gas 4. While the dates are soaking, make the puddings. Mix the flour and bicarbonate of soda together and beat the eggs in a separate bowl. Beat the butter and sugar together in a large bowl for a few mins until slightly creamy (the mixture will be grainy from the sugar). Add the eggs a little at a time, beating well between additions. Beat in the black treacle then, using a large metal spoon, gently fold in one-third of the flour, then half the milk, being careful not to overbeat. Repeat until all the flour and milk is used. Stir the soaked dates into the pudding batter. The mix may look a little curdled at this point and will be like a soft, thick batter. Spoon it evenly between the tins and bake for 20-25 mins, until risen and firm. Meanwhile, put the sugar and butter for the sauce in a medium saucepan with half the cream. Bring to the boil over a medium heat, stirring all the time, until the sugar has completely dissolved. Stir in the black treacle, turn up the heat slightly and let the mixture bubble away for 2-3 mins until it is a rich toffee colour, stirring occasionally to make sure it doesn’t burn. Take the pan off the heat and beat in the rest of the cream. Remove the puddings from the oven. Leave in the tins for a few mins, then loosen them well from the sides of the tins with a small palette knife before turning them out. You can serve them now with the sauce drizzled over, but they’ll be even stickier if left for a day or two coated in the sauce. To do this, pour about half the sauce into one or two ovenproof serving dishes. Sit the upturned puddings on the sauce, then pour the rest of the sauce over them. Cover with a loose tent of foil so that the sauce doesn’t smudge (no need to chill). When ready to serve, heat oven to 180C/fan 160C/gas 4. Warm the puddings through, still covered, for 15-20 mins or until the sauce is bubbling. Serve them on their own, or with cream or custard.	https://www.themealdb.com/images/media/meals/xrptpq1483909204.jpg	Pudding,Desert,Cake,Dairy	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKq6RbxJHBo	2020-10-27 21:11:28	2020-10-27 21:11:28	Medjool dates	water	vanilla extract	self-raising flour	bicarbonate of soda	eggs	butter	demerara sugar	black treacle	milk	ice cream	muscovado sugar	butter	double cream	black treacle						225g	175ml Boiling	1 tsp	175g	1 tsp	2	85g	140g	2 tbsp	100ml	1 scoop	175g	50g	225ml	1 tbsp					
196	Spicy North African Potato Salad	Moroccan	Cook potatoes - place potatoes in a pot of cold water, and bring to the boil. Boil 20 minutes, or until potatoes are tender. You know they are cooked when you can stick a knife in them and the knife goes straight through. Combine harissa spice, olive oil, salt and pepper and lemon juice in a small bowl and whisk until combined. Once potatoes are cooked, drain water and roughly chop potatoes in half. Add harissa mix and spring onions/green onions to potatoes and stir. In a large salad bowl, lay out arugula/rocket. Top with potato mix and toss. Add fetta, mint and sprinkle over pine nuts. Adjust salt and pepper to taste.	https://www.themealdb.com/images/media/meals/urtwux1486983078.jpg	Vegetarian,Spicy	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxBzwJvTK4g	2020-10-27 21:11:28	2020-10-27 21:11:28	Small Potatoes	Harissa Spice	olive oil	Lemon	Spring onions	Rocket	Feta	Mint	Pine nuts	Salt	Pepper										650g/1lb 8 oz	1 tsp	2 tsp	juice of half	4	150g/6oz	80g/3oz	20 chopped	2 tablespoons	Pinch	Pinch									
197	Stovetop Eggplant With Harissa, Chickpeas, and Cumin Yogurt	American	Heat the oil in a 12-inch skillet over high heat until shimmering. Add the eggplants and lower the heat to medium. Season with salt and pepper as you rotate the eggplants, browning them on all sides. Continue to cook, turning regularly, until a fork inserted into the eggplant meets no resistance (you may have to stand them up on their fat end to finish cooking the thickest parts), about 20 minutes, lowering the heat and sprinkling water into the pan as necessary if the eggplants threaten to burn or smoke excessively. 2. Mix the harissa, chickpeas and tomatoes together, then add to the eggplants. Cook until the tomatoes have blistered and broken down, about 5 minutes more. Season with salt and pepper and add water as necessary to thin to a saucy consistency. Meanwhile, combine the yogurt and cumin in a serving bowl. Season with salt and pepper. 3. Top the eggplant mixture with the parsley, drizzle with more extra virgin olive oil, and serve with the yogurt on the side.	https://www.themealdb.com/images/media/meals/yqwtvu1487426027.jpg	Vegetarian	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYB-1xJp4lg	2020-10-27 21:11:28	2020-10-27 21:11:28	Olive Oil	Egg Plants	Harissa	Chickpeas	Cherry Tomatoes	Greek yogurt	Ground cumin	Parsley													4 tablespoons	6 small	½ tablespoon	1 can	2 cups halved	1 1/2 cups	1 tablespoon	½ cup

199	Salted Caramel Cheescake	American	1) Blitz the biscuits and the pretzels in a food processor and mix the biscuits with the melted butter. Spread on the bottom of an 8″/20cm Deep Springform Tin and press down firmly. Leave to set in the fridge whilst you make the rest! 2) Using an electric mixer, I use my KitchenAid with the whisk attachment, whisk together the cream cheese, vanilla, and icing sugar until smooth and then add the caramel and whisk again until smooth and lump free – this could take a couple of minutes, I whisk it at half speed so not too quick or slow! 3) Pour in the double cream & Salt flakes and continue to whisk for a couple of minutes until its very thick and mousse like (I mix it on a medium speed, level 6/10) – Now this could take up to 5 minutes depending on your mixer, but you seriously have to stick at it – it will hold itself completely when finished mixing (like a meringue does!) If you don’t mix it enough it will not set well enough, but don’t get impatient and whisk it really quick because that’ll make it split! Spread over the biscuit base and leave to set in the fridge overnight. 4) Remove the Cheesecake from the tin carefully and decorate the cheesecake – I drizzled over some of the spare caramel, and then some Toffee Popcorn and more Pretzels!	https://www.themealdb.com/images/media/meals/xqrwyr1511133646.jpg	null	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5dQp3qpmI4	2020-10-27 21:11:28	2020-10-27 21:11:28	Digestive Biscuits	Pretzels	Butter	Cream Cheese	Vanilla Extract	Icing Sugar	Caramel	Sea Salt	Double Cream	Caramel Sauce	Toffee Popcorn	Pretzels									250g	75g	135g	450g	1tsp	100g	150g	1tsp	300ml	drizzle	Top	Top								
200	Seafood fideuà	Spanish	Boil the kettle. Empty the mussels into a colander and run under cold water. Throw away any with broken shells. Pick through the shells, tapping each one on the side of the sink – they should be closed or should slowly close when tapped – if they stay open, throw them away. If any of the shells still have barnacles or stringy beards attached, pull them off with a cutlery knife and rinse the shells well. Keep in the colander, covered with a cold, damp cloth, until you’re ready to cook. Peel the prawn shells on the body section only – leave the heads and tails intact. Score down the backs and pull out any gritty entrails. Chill until you’re ready to cook. Put the saffron in a small cup, cover with 50ml kettle-hot water and set aside for 10 mins. If using vermicelli, put in a bowl and crush to little pieces (about 1cm long) with your hands. Heat the oil in a large frying pan with at least a 3cm lip, or a 40cm paella pan. Add the onion and stir around the pan for 5 mins until soft. Add the garlic and cook for 1 min more, then tip in the vermicelli and cook for 5 mins, stirring from time to time, until the vermicelli is toasted brown. Stir in the paprika. Keeping the heat moderate, stir through the monkfish, squid and saffron with its water, seasoning well. Spread the ingredients out in an even layer, then pour over the hot stock and scatter the tomatoes on top. Bring to a simmer, then cover the whole dish with a tight-fitting lid (or foil). Turn the heat to medium and cook for 6 mins. Uncover and stir to incorporate the dry top layer of pasta. Push the mussels into the pasta so the hinges are buried in the bottom of the dish, and they stand straight up. Arrange the prawns on top, cover tightly and cook for another 6 mins or until the mussels are open, the prawns are pink and the pasta is cooked through. Leave to simmer for another 2-3 mins to cook off most of the remaining liquid (leave a little in the pan to prevent the pasta from sticking together). Allow to sit for 2-3 mins, then squeeze over the lemon juice and arrange the wedges on top. Scatter with parsley before serving.	https://www.themealdb.com/images/media/meals/wqqvyq1511179730.jpg	null	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itsFEc8W468	2020-10-27 21:11:28	2020-10-27 21:11:28	Mussels	Prawns	Saffron	Vermicelli	Olive Oil	Onions	Garlic	Paprika	Monkfish	Baby Squid	Fish Stock	Tomatoes	Lemon	Parsley							400g	8	2 pinches	350g	5 tblsp	1 large	3 cloves	2 tbs	1 tail	4	650ml	2 large	Juice of 1	Topping						
201	Spinach & Ricotta Cannelloni	Italian	First make the tomato sauce. Heat the oil in a large pan and fry the garlic for 1 min. Add the sugar, vinegar, tomatoes and some seasoning and simmer for 20 mins, stirring occasionally, until thick. Add the basil and divide the sauce between 2 or more shallow ovenproof dishes (see Tips for freezing, below). Set aside. Make a sauce by beating the mascarpone with the milk until smooth, season, then set aside. Put the spinach in a large colander and pour over a kettle of boiling water to wilt it (you may need to do this in batches). When cool enough to handle squeeze out the excess water. Roughly chop the spinach and mix in a large bowl with 100g Parmesan and ricotta. Season well with salt, pepper and the nutmeg. Heat oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Using a piping bag or plastic food bag with the corner snipped off, squeeze the filling into the cannelloni tubes. Lay the tubes, side by side, on top of the tomato sauce and spoon over the mascarpone sauce. Top with Parmesan and mozzarella. You can now freeze the cannelloni, uncooked, or you can cook it first and then freeze. Bake for 30-35 mins until golden and bubbling. Remove from oven and let stand for 5 mins before serving.	https://www.themealdb.com/images/media/meals/wspuvp1511303478.jpg	null	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYGaEJjyLQA	2020-10-27 21:11:28	2020-10-27 21:11:28	Olive Oil	Garlic	Caster Sugar	Red Wine Vinegar	Chopped Tomatoes	Basil Leaves	Mascarpone	Milk	Parmesan	Mozzarella	Spinach	Parmesan	Ricotta	Nutmeg	Cannellini Beans						3 tbsp	8 cloves chopped	3 tbsp	2 tblsp	3 400g Cans	Bunch	2 tubs	3 tbsp	85g	2 sliced	1kg	100g	3 tubs	pinch	400g					
203	Spanish Tortilla	Spanish	Put a large non-stick frying pan on a low heat. Cook the onion slowly in the oil and butter until soft but not brown – this should take about 15 mins. Add the potatoes, cover the pan and cook for a further 15-20 mins, stirring occasionally to make sure they fry evenly. When the potatoes are soft and the onion is shiny, crush 2 garlic cloves and stir in, followed by the beaten eggs. Put the lid back on the pan and leave the tortilla to cook gently. After 20 mins, the edges and base should be golden, the top set but the middle still a little wobbly. To turn it over, slide it onto a plate and put another plate on top, turn the whole thing over and slide it back into the pan to finish cooking. Once cooked, transfer to a plate and serve the tortilla warm or cold, scattered with the chopped parsley. To accompany, take slices of warmed baguette, stab all over with a fork and rub with the remaining garlic, pile on grated tomatoes and season with sea salt and a drizzle of olive oil.	https://www.themealdb.com/images/media/meals/quuxsx1511476154.jpg	Egg,Light	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JceGMNG7rpU	2020-10-27 21:11:28	2020-10-27 21:11:28	Onion	Olive Oil	Butter	Potatoes	Garlic	Eggs	Parsley	Baguette	Vine Tomatoes	Olive Oil											1 sliced	4 tbsp	25g	400g	6 cloves	8	Handful	1	4	drizzle										
204	Steak and Kidney Pie	British	Preheat the oven to 220C/425F/Gas 7 Heat the vegetable oil in a large frying pan, and brown the beef all over. (You may need to do this in batches.) Set aside, then brown the kidneys on both sides in the same pan. Add the onions and cook for 3-4 minutes. Return the beef to the pan, sprinkle flour over and coat the meat and onions Add the stock to the pan, stir well and bring to the boil. Turn the heat down and simmer for 1½ hours without a lid. If the liquid evaporates too much, add more stock. Remove from the heat. Add salt, pepper and Worcestershire sauce and allow to cool completely. Place the cooked meat mixture into a pie dish. Roll out the pastry to 5mm/¼in thick and 5cm/2in larger than the dish you are using. Using a rolling pin, lift the pastry and place it over the top of the pie dish. Trim and crimp the edges with your fingers and thumb. Brush the surface with the beaten egg mixture and bake for 30-40 minutes until golden-brown and puffed. Serve with creamy mash and steamed vegetables to soak up the gravy.	https://www.themealdb.com/images/media/meals/qysyss1511558054.jpg	Pie	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTw5tPt4KmA	2020-10-27 21:11:28	2020-10-27 21:11:28	Puff Pastry	Egg White	Egg Yolks	Vegetable Oil	Beef	Lamb Kidney	Onions	Plain Flour	Beef Stock	Salt	Pepper	Worcestershire Sauce	null								300g	Beaten	Beaten	2 tbs	70 ml	200g	2 chopped	30g	85 ml	pinch	pinch	Dash

Put the butter, sugar, eggs, flour, baking powder, bicarbonate of soda and treacle into a mixing bowl. Beat using an electric handheld whisk for about 30 seconds or until combined. Pour in the milk gradually and whisk again until smooth. Pour into the prepared dish. Bake for 35–40 minutes or until well risen and springy in the centre. To make the sauce, put all the ingredients into a saucepan and stir over a low heat until the sugar has dissolved and the butter has melted. Bring to the boil, stirring for a minute. To serve, pour half the sauce over the pudding in the baking dish. Serve with the cream or ice cream.	https://www.themealdb.com/images/media/meals/xqqqtu1511637379.jpg	Pudding,Cake,Desert	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wytv3bjqJII	2020-10-27 21:11:28	2020-10-27 21:11:28	Butter	Muscovado Sugar	Eggs	Self-raising Flour	Baking Powder	Bicarbonate Of Soda	Black Treacle	Milk	Double Cream	Butter	Muscovado Sugar	Black Treacle	Double Cream	Vanilla Extract							100g	175g	2 large	225g	1 tsp	1 tsp	3 tbs	275ml	to serve	100g	125g	1 tbs	300ml	1 tsp

Pour in 150ml milk and mix to a firm but moist dough, adding the extra milk if necessary. Shape into a fat roll about 20cm long. Place on a large rectangle of baking parchment. Wrap loosely to allow for the pudding to rise and tie the ends with string like a Christmas cracker. Place a steamer over a large pan of boiling water, add the pudding to the steamer, cover and steam for 1 1/2 hours. Top up the pan with water from time to time. Remove from the steamer and allow to cool slightly before unwrapping. Serve sliced with custard.	https://www.themealdb.com/images/media/meals/xqvyqr1511638875.jpg	Fruity,Pudding,Desert	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fu15XOF-ros	2020-10-27 21:11:28	2020-10-27 21:11:28	Self-raising Flour	Salt	Suet	Currants	Caster Sugar	Lemon	Orange	Milk	Custard												250g	pinch	125g	175g	80g	Zest of 1	Zest of 1	150ml	to serve											
207	Summer Pudding	British	Bring out the juices: Wash fruit and gently dry on kitchen paper – keep strawberries separate. Put sugar and 3 tbsp water into a large pan. Gently heat until sugar dissolves – stir a few times. Bring to a boil for 1 min, then tip in the fruit (not strawberries). Cook for 3 mins over a low heat, stirring 2-3 times. The fruit will be softened, mostly intact and surrounded by dark red juice. Put a sieve over a bowl and tip in the fruit and juice. Line the bowl with cling film and prepare the bread: Line the 1.25-litre basin with cling film as this will help you to turn out the pudding. Overlap two pieces of cling film in the middle of the bowl as it’s easier than trying to get one sheet to stick to all of the curves. Let the edges overhang by about 15cm. Cut the crusts off the bread. Cut 4 pieces of bread in half, a little on an angle, to give 2 lopsided rectangles per piece. Cut 2 slices into 4 triangles each and leave the final piece whole. Build the pud: Dip the whole piece of bread into the juice for a few secs just to coat. Push this into the bottom of the basin. Now dip the wonky rectangular pieces one at a time and press around the basin’s sides so that they fit together neatly, alternately placing wide and narrow ends up. If you can’t quite fit the last piece of bread in it doesn’t matter, just trim into a triangle, dip in juice and slot in. Now spoon in the softened fruit, adding the strawberries here and there as you go. Let flavours mingle then serve: Dip the bread triangles in juice and place on top – trim off overhang with scissors. Keep leftover juice for later. Bring cling film up and loosely seal. Put a side plate on top and weight down with cans. Chill for 6 hrs or overnight. To serve, open out cling film then put a serving plate upside-down on top and flip over. serve with leftover juice, any extra berries and cream.	https://www.themealdb.com/images/media/meals/rsqwus1511640214.jpg	Summer	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akJIO6UhXtA	2020-10-27 21:11:28	2020-10-27 21:11:28	Strawberries	Blackberries	Redcurrants	Raspberries	Caster Sugar	Bread															300g	250g	100g	500g	175g	7 Slices

Pour in the stock, add three-quarters of the haricot beans with the green beans, half the tomatoes, and simmer for 5-8 mins until the vegetables are tender. Meanwhile, blitz the remaining beans and tomatoes, the garlic and basil in a food processor (or in a bowl with a stick blender) until smooth, then stir in the Parmesan. Stir the sauce into the soup, cook for 1 min, then ladle half into bowls or pour into a flask for a packed lunch. Chill the remainder.

209	Split Pea Soup	Canadian	Put the gammon in a very large pan with 2 litres water and bring to the boil. Remove from the heat and drain off the water – this helps to get rid of some of the saltiness. Recover with 2 litres cold water and bring to the boil again. Put everything but the frozen peas into the pan and bring to the boil. Reduce to a simmer and cook for 1½-2½ hrs, topping up the water as and when you need to, to a similar level it started at. As the ham cooks and softens, you can halve it if you want, so it is all submerged under the liquid. When the ham is tender enough to pull into shreds, it is ready. Lift out the ham, peel off and discard the skin. While it is still hot (wear a clean pair of rubber gloves), shred the meat. Remove bay from the soup and stir in the frozen peas. Simmer for 1 min, then blend until smooth. Add a splash of water if too thick, and return to the pan to heat through if it has cooled, or if you are making ahead. When you are ready to serve, mix the hot soup with most of the ham – gently reheat if made ahead. Serve in bowls with the remaining ham scattered on top, and eat with crusty bread and butter.	https://www.themealdb.com/images/media/meals/xxtsvx1511814083.jpg	Soup,Warm	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdhWz7qAaCU	2020-10-27 21:11:28	2020-10-27 21:11:28	Ham	Peas	Onions	Carrots	Bay Leaves	Celery	Frozen Peas	Bread													1kg	200g (soaked overnight)	2 chopped	2 chopped	2	1 chopped	300g	to serve

Place the brown sugar and butter in a mixing bowl, and beat them together with an electric mixer until creamy and very well combined, without lumps. Beat in eggs, one at a time, incorporating the first egg before adding the next one. Add the vanilla extract and salt; beat the flour in, a little at a time, and then the milk, making a creamy batter. Pour the batter into the prepared pie dish. Bake in the preheated oven for 35 minutes; remove pie, and cover the rim with aluminum foil to prevent burning. Return to oven, and bake until the middle sets and the top forms a crusty layer, about 15 more minutes. Let the pie cool to room temperature, then refrigerate for at least 1 hour before serving.	https://www.themealdb.com/images/media/meals/yrstur1511816601.jpg	Pie,Desert	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVQ66jiL-Dc	2020-10-27 21:11:28	2020-10-27 21:11:28	Brown Sugar	Butter	Eggs	Vanilla Extract	Salt	Plain Flour	Milk														2 cups	¼ cup	2	1 tsp	1 tsp	½ cup	1 1/2 cups

Transfer steaks to a plate, and set aside. Return skillet to high heat, and add stock; cook until reduced until to 1⁄2 cup, about 10 minutes. Pour into a bowl, and set aside. Return skillet to heat, and add butter; add garlic and shallots, and cook, stirring, until soft, about 2 minutes. Add mushrooms, and cook, stirring, until they release any liquid and it evaporates and mushrooms begin to brown, about 2 minutes. Add cognac, and light with a match to flambée; cook until flame dies down. Stir in reserved stock, cream, Dijon, Worcestershire, and hot sauce, and then return steaks to skillet; cook, turning in sauce, until warmed through and sauce is thickened, about 4 minutes. Transfer steak to serving plates and stir parsley and chives into sauce; pour sauce over steaks to serve.	https://www.themealdb.com/images/media/meals/vussxq1511882648.jpg	DateNight,Expensive,Meat,MainMeal,Cheasy	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rWZNHkrsNg	2020-10-27 21:11:28	2020-10-27 21:11:28	Canola Oil	Beef Fillet	Beef Stock	Butter	Garlic	Challots	Mushrooms	Brandy	Heavy Cream	Dijon Mustard	Worcestershire Sauce	Tabasco Sauce	Parsley	Chives	Salt	Pepper					2 tbs	4	1 1/2 cup	2 tbs	2 cloves minced	1 medium finely diced	4 oz	¼ cup	¼ cup	1 tbs	1 tbs	Dash	1 tbs minced	1 tbs minced	to taste	to taste				
212	Saltfish and Ackee	Jamaican	For the saltfish, soak the salt cod overnight, changing the water a couple of times. Drain, then put the cod in a large pan of fresh water and bring to the boil. Drain again, add fresh water and bring to the boil again. Simmer for about five minutes, or until cooked through, then drain and flake the fish into large pieces. Discard any skin or bones. For the dumplings, mix the flour and suet with a pinch of salt and 250ml/9fl oz water to make a dough. Wrap the mixture in clingfilm and leave in the fridge to rest. Open the can of ackee, drain and rinse, then set aside. Heat a tablespoon of olive oil in a pan and fry the onion until softened but not brown. Add the spices, seasoning, pepper sauce and sliced peppers and continue to fry until the peppers are tender. Add the chopped tomatoes, then the salt cod and mix together.

Trim any coarse stems and discard any brown leaves. With a sharp knife, cut the curly kale into thin strips. Peel and chop the shallots. In a frying pan or skillet, melt 1 tbsp. of butter and saute the shallots for a few minutes before adding the curly kale and 2 tbsp. of water. Season and cook for about 10 minutes, or until tender. Warm the milk on the stove or in the microwave. Drain, shake and dry the potatoes with kitchen towels before mashing with a potato masher or ricer. Working quickly, add the warm milk and the remaining butter. Season to taste with nutmeg, salt, and pepper. Mix the cooked curly kale through the cooked mashed potato mixture. Top with slices of the smoked sausage and serve hot with your favorite mustard or gravy.

Set aside. Add the celery, carrots, potato, onion, leek, and celeriac to the soup. Return to the boil, reduce the heat to a simmer and let cook, uncovered, for another 30 minutes, adding a little extra water if the ingredients start to stick to the bottom of the pot. Add the smoked sausage for the last 15 minutes of cooking time. When the vegetables are tender, remove the bacon and smoked sausage, slice thinly and set aside. If you prefer a smooth consistency, purée the soup with a stick blender. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Add the meat back to the soup, setting some slices of rookworst aside.

222	Spaghetti alla Carbonara	Italian	Per preparare gli spaghetti alla carbonara cominciate mettendo sul fuoco una pentola con l’acqua salata per cuocere la pasta. Nel frattempo eliminate la cotenna dal guanciale e tagliatelo prima a fette e poi a striscioline spesse circa 1cm . La cotenna avanzata potrà essere riutilizzata per insaporire altre preparazioni. Versate i pezzetti in una padella antiaderente e rosolate per circa 15 minuti a fiamma media, fate attenzione a non bruciarlo altrimenti rilascerà un aroma troppo forte. Nel frattempo tuffate gli spaghetti nell’acqua bollente e cuoceteli per il tempo indicato sulla confezione. Intanto versate i tuorli in una ciotola, aggiungete anche la maggior parte del pecorino previsto dalla ricetta la parte restante servirà per guarnire la pasta. Insaporite con il pepe nero, amalgamate tutto con una frusta a mano. Aggiungete un cucchiaio di acqua di cottura per diluire il composto e mescolate. Intanto il guanciale sarà giunto a cottura, spegnete il fuoco e tenetelo da parte. Scolate la pasta al dente direttamente nel tegame con il guanciale e saltatela brevemente per insaporirla. Togliete dal fuoco e versate il composto di uova e pecorino nel tegame, saltate la pasta per amalgamare e se dovesse risultare troppo asciutta potete aggiungere poca acqua di cottura. Servite subito gli spaghetti alla carbonara insaporendoli con il pecorino avanzato e il pepe nero macinato.	https://www.themealdb.com/images/media/meals/llcbn01574260722.jpg	Pasta,BBQ,Breakfast	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_T6jkRvhlkk	2020-10-27 21:11:28	2020-10-27 21:11:28	Spaghetti	Egg Yolks	Salt	Bacon	Pecorino	Black Pepper															320g	6	As required	150g	50g	As required

Trim, peel, and cut carrots on a diagonal into 1/2-inch-thick pieces. Trim and thinly slice scallions, separating whites from greens; finely chop whites. Peel and finely chop garlic. 2. In a medium bowl, soak bread with 2 TBSP water (4 TBSP for 4 servings); break up with your hands until pasty. Stir in beef, sriracha, scallion whites, half the garlic, salt (we used 3/4 tsp kosher salt; 11/2 tsp for 4), and pepper. Form into two 1-inch-tall loaves (four loaves for 4). Place on one side of a baking sheet. Toss carrots on empty side of same sheet with a drizzle of oil, salt, and pepper. (For 4, spread meatloaves out across whole sheet and add carrots to a second sheet.) Bake for 20 minutes (we ll glaze the meatloaves then). 3. Meanwhile, place potatoes in a medium pot with enough salted water to cover by 2 inches. Bring to a boil and cook until very tender, 12-15 minutes. Reserve 1/2 cup potato cooking liquid, then drain. While potatoes cook, in a small bowl, combine soy sauce, garlic powder, 1/4 cup ketchup (1/2 cup for 4 servings), and 2 tsp sugar (4 tsp for 4). 4. Once meatloaves and carrots have baked 20 minutes, remove from oven. Spoon half the ketchup glaze over meatloaves (save the rest for serving); return to oven until carrots are browned and tender, meatloaves are cooked through, and glaze is tacky, 4-5 minutes more. 5. Meanwhile, melt 2 TBSP butter (4 TBSP for 4 servings) in pot used for potatoes over medium heat. Add remaining garlic and cook until fragrant, 30 seconds. Add potatoes and 1/4 tsp wasabi. Mash, adding splashes of reserved potato cooking liquid as necessary until smooth. Season with salt and pepper. (If you like things spicy, stir in more wasabi!) 6.

228	Shawarma	Egyptian	Combine the marinade ingredients in a large ziplock bag (or bowl). Add the chicken and use your hands to make sure each piece is coated. If using a ziplock bag, I find it convenient to close the bag then massage the bag to disperse the rub all over each chicken piece. Marinate overnight or up to 24 hours. Combine the Yoghurt Sauce ingredients in a bowl and mix. Cover and put in the fridge until required (it will last for 3 days in the fridge). Heat grill/BBQ (or large heavy based pan on stove) on medium high. You should not need to oil it because the marinade has oil in it and also thigh fillets have fat. But if you are worried then oil your hotplate/grill. (See notes for baking) Place chicken on the grill and cook the first side for 4 to 5 minutes until nicely charred, then turn and cook the other side for 3 to 4 minutes (the 2nd side takes less time). Remove chicken from the grill and cover loosely with foil. Set aside to rest for 5 minutes. TO SERVE Slice chicken and pile onto platter alongside flatbreads, Salad and the Yoghurt Sauce. To make a wrap, get a piece of flatbread and smear with Yoghurt Sauce. Top with a bit of lettuce and tomato and Chicken Shawarma.

In a wok or large frying pan, heat the oil until very hot, then drop in the garlic and cook until golden, this should take only a few seconds. Don’t let it go very dark or it will spoil the taste. Spoon in the curry paste and stir it around for a few seconds to begin to cook the spices and release all the flavours. Next, pour in the coconut milk and let it come to a bubble. Stir in the fish sauce and sugar, then the pieces of chicken. Turn the heat down to a simmer and cook, covered, for about 8 minutes until the chicken is cooked. Tip in the potatoes and beans and let them warm through in the hot coconut milk, then add a lovely citrussy flavour by stirring in the shredded lime leaves (or lime zest). The basil leaves go in next, but only leave them briefly on the heat or they will quickly lose their brightness. Scatter with the lime garnish and serve immediately with boiled rice.	https://www.themealdb.com/images/media/meals/sstssx1487349585.jpg	Curry,Mild	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIbKVpBQKJI	2020-10-27 21:11:28	2020-10-27 21:11:28	potatoes	green beans	sunflower oil	garlic	Thai green curry paste	coconut milk	Thai fish sauce	Sugar	Chicken	lime	basil	Rice									225g new	100g	1 tbsp	1 clove	4 tsp	400ml	2 tsp	1 tsp	450g boneless	2 fresh kaffir leaves	handfull	Boiled								
233	Turkey Meatloaf	British	Heat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Heat the oil in a large frying pan and cook the onion for 8-10 mins until softened. Add the garlic, Worcestershire sauce and 2 tsp tomato purée, and stir until combined. Set aside to cool. Put the turkey mince, egg, breadcrumbs and cooled onion mix in a large bowl and season well. Mix everything to combine, then shape into a rectangular loaf and place in a large roasting tin. Spread 2 tbsp barbecue sauce over the meatloaf and bake for 30 mins. Meanwhile, drain 1 can of beans only, then pour both cans into a large bowl. Add the remaining barbecue sauce and tomato purée. Season and set aside. When the meatloaf has had its initial cooking time, scatter the beans around the outside and bake for 15 mins more until the meatloaf is cooked through and the beans are piping hot. Scatter over the parsley and serve the meatloaf in slices.	https://www.themealdb.com/images/media/meals/ypuxtw1511297463.jpg	Alcoholic	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTvlmY4vCug	2020-10-27 21:11:28	2020-10-27 21:11:28	Olive Oil	Onion	Garlic	Worcestershire Sauce	Tomato Puree	Turkey Mince	Eggs	Breadcrumbs	Barbeque Sauce	Cannellini Beans	Parsley										1 tblsp	1 large	1 clove peeled crushed	2 tblsp	3 tsp	500g	1 large	85g	2 tblsp	800g	2 tblsp

236	Three Fish Pie	British	Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6 (180C fan). Put the potatoes into a saucepan of cold salted water. Bring up to the boil and simmer until completely tender. Drain well and then mash with the butter and milk. Add pepper and taste to check the seasoning. Add salt and more pepper if necessary. For the fish filling, melt the butter in a saucepan, add the leeks and stir over the heat. Cover with a lid and simmer gently for 10 minutes, or until soft. Measure the flour into a small bowl. Add the wine and whisk together until smooth. Add the milk to the leeks, bring to the boil and then add the wine mixture. Stir briskly until thickened. Season and add the parsley and fish. Stir over the heat for two minutes, then spoon into an ovenproof casserole. Scatter over the eggs. Allow to cool until firm. Spoon the mashed potatoes over the fish mixture and mark with a fork. Sprinkle with cheese. Bake for 30-40 minutes, or until lightly golden-brown on top and bubbling around the edges.	https://www.themealdb.com/images/media/meals/spswqs1511558697.jpg	Fish,Seafood,Dairy,Pie	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds1Jb8H5Sg8	2020-10-27 21:11:28	2020-10-27 21:11:28	Potatoes	Butter	Milk	Gruyère	Butter	Leek	Plain Flour	White Wine	Milk	Parsley	Salmon	Haddock	Smoked Haddock	Eggs							1kg	Knob	Dash	50g	75g	2 sliced	75g	150ml	568ml	2 tbs chopped	250g	250g	250g	6						
237	Treacle Tart	British	First make the short crust pastry: measure the flour into a large bowl and rub in the butter with your fingertips until the mixture resembles fine breadcrumbs (alternatively, this can be done in a food processor). Add about three tablespoons of cold water and mix to a firm dough, wrap in cling film and chill in the fridge for about 20 minutes. Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6 and put a heavy baking tray in the oven to heat up. Grease a deep 18cm/7in loose-bottomed fluted flan tin with butter. Remove about 150g/5½oz of pastry from the main ball and set aside for the lattice top. Roll the rest of the pastry out thinly on a lightly floured work surface and line the prepared flan tin with the pastry. Prick the base with a fork, to stop the base rising up during baking. Place the reserved pastry for the lattice top on cling film and roll out thinly. Egg wash the pastry and set aside to chill in the fridge (the cling film makes it easier to move about). Do not cut into strips at this stage. Do not egg wash the strips once they are on the tart as it will drip into the treacle mixture. To make the filling, heat the syrup gently in a large pan but do not boil. Once melted, add the breadcrumbs, lemon juice and zest to the syrup. (You can add less lemon if you would prefer less citrus taste.) If the mixture looks runny, add a few more breadcrumbs. Pour the syrup mixture into the lined tin and level the surface. Remove the reserved pastry from the fridge and cut into long strips, 1cm/½in wide. Make sure they are all longer than the edges of the tart tin. Egg wash the edge of the pastry in the tin, and start to make the woven laying lattice pattern over the mixture, leave the strips hanging over the edge of the tin. Once the lattice is in place, use the tin edge to cut off the strips by pressing down with your hands, creating a neat finish. Bake on the pre-heated baking tray in the hot oven for about 10 minutes until the pastry has started to colour, and then reduce the oven temperature to 180C/350F/Gas 4. If at this stage the lattice seems to be getting too dark brown, cover the tart with tin foil. Bake for a further 25-30 minutes until the pastry is golden-brown and the filling set. Remove the tart from the oven and leave to firm up in the tin. Serve warm or cold.	https://www.themealdb.com/images/media/meals/wprvrw1511641295.jpg	Tart	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMmgKCNcqwI	2020-10-27 21:11:28	2020-10-27 21:11:28	Plain Flour	Butter	Golden Syrup	Breadcrumbs	Lemons	Eggs															250g	135g	400g	150g	Zest of 2	1 beaten

238	Tarte Tatin	French	Roll the pastry to a 3mm-thick round on a lightly floured surface and cut a 24cm circle, using a plate as a guide. Lightly prick all over with a fork, wrap in cling film on a baking sheet and freeze while preparing the apples. Heat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Peel, quarter and core the apples. Put the sugar in a flameproof 20cm ceramic Tatin dish or a 20cm ovenproof heavy-based frying pan and place over a medium-high heat. Cook the sugar for 5-7 mins to a dark amber caramel syrup that’s starting to smoke, then turn off the heat and stir in the 60g diced chilled butter. To assemble the Tarte Tatin, arrange the apple quarters very tightly in a circle around the edge of the dish first, rounded-side down, then fill in the middle in a similar fashion. Gently press with your hands to ensure there are no gaps. Brush the fruit with the melted butter. Bake in the oven for 30 mins, then remove and place the disc of frozen puff pastry on top – it will quickly defrost. Tuck the edges down the inside of the dish and, with a knife, prick a few holes in the pastry to allow steam to escape. Bake for a further 40-45 mins until the pastry is golden brown and crisp. Allow to cool to room temperature for 1 hr before running a knife around the edge of the dish and inverting it onto a large serving plate that is deep enough to contain the juices. Serve with crème fraîche or vanilla ice cream.	https://www.themealdb.com/images/media/meals/ryspuw1511786688.jpg	Treat,Tart,Desert,DinnerParty	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xDM8U6h9Pw	2020-10-27 21:11:28	2020-10-27 21:11:28	Puff Pastry	Plain Flour	Braeburn Apples	Caster Sugar	Butter	Creme Fraiche															300g	Dusting	6	100g	85g	to serve														
239	Three-cheese souffles	French	Heat oven to 200C/180C fan/ gas 6 and butter 4 small (about 200ml) ramekins. Sprinkle the Parmesan into the ramekins, turning until all sides are covered. Place the milk and bay leaves in a large saucepan over a gentle heat and bring to the boil. Turn off the heat and leave to infuse for 15 mins. Discard the bay leaves, add the butter and flour, and return to a low heat. Very gently simmer, stirring continuously with a balloon whisk, for about 6 mins until you get a smooth, thick white sauce. Make sure that you get right into the corners of the pan to stop the sauce from catching or becoming lumpy. Once thickened, transfer the sauce to a large bowl and stir in the mustard powder, cayenne pepper, Gruyère and egg yolks until fully combined. In a spotlessly clean bowl and with a clean whisk, beat the egg whites just until peaks begin to form. Carefully fold the egg whites into the cheese sauce in three stages making sure you fold, rather than stir, to keep the egg whites light and airy. Fill the prepared ramekins with the soufflé mix. Top each soufflé with a slice of goat’s cheese, then place on a baking tray. Bake for 20-25 mins or until springy and well risen but cooked through. Leave to cool, then run a knife around the edge of each dish and remove the soufflés. If preparing in advance, place soufflés upside down (for neat presentation), on a tray. Cover tray in cling film. Chill for a few days or freeze for up to 1 month. When ready to re-bake, heat oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Place the upside-down soufflés in a shallow baking dish, top with the remaining goat’s cheese slices and pour over the cream (this stops them from drying out when baked for the second time). Cook for 8-10 mins until golden. Serve immediately alongside some simply dressed salad.	https://www.themealdb.com/images/media/meals/sxwquu1511793428.jpg	Baking	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mS_gbQpBvZo	2020-10-27 21:11:28	2020-10-27 21:11:28	Butter	Parmesan	Milk	Bay Leaves	Plain Flour	English Mustard	Cayenne Pepper	Gruyère	Eggs	Goats Cheese	Double Cream	Spinach									50g	25g	300ml	2	5 tbs	½ tsp	Pod of	140g	3	8 slices	150ml	to serve

Heat the oil in a non-stick pan, add the mince and onion and quickly fry until browned. Add the garlic, spices, stock, plenty of pepper and a little salt and mix well. Remove from the heat, stir into the potato and leave to cool. Roll out half the pastry and line the base of a 20-23cm pie plate or flan tin. Fill with the pork mixture and brush the edges of the pastry with water. Roll out the remaining dough and cover the pie. Press the edges of the pastry to seal, trimming off the excess. Prick the top of the pastry case to allow steam to escape and glaze the top with the beaten egg. Bake for 30 mins until the pastry is crisp and golden. Serve cut into wedges with a crisp green salad. Leftovers are good cold for lunch the next day, served with a selection of pickles.	https://www.themealdb.com/images/media/meals/ytpstt1511814614.jpg	Pie,MainMeal,BBQ,Cake	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A96hbwobKKs	2020-10-27 21:11:28	2020-10-27 21:11:28	Potatoes	Sunflower Oil	Minced Pork	Onion	Garlic Clove	Cinnamon	Allspice	Nutmeg	Vegetable Stock	Shortcrust Pastry	Egg										1 medium	1 tsp	500g	1 finely chopped	1 finely chopped	¼ tsp	¼ tsp	¼ tsp	100ml	400g	To Glaze

244	Tuna and Egg Briks	Tunisian	Heat 2 tsp of the oil in a large saucepan and cook the spring onions over a low heat for 3 minutes or until beginning to soften. Add the spinach, cover with a tight-fitting lid and cook for a further 2–3 minutes or until tender and wilted, stirring once or twice. Tip the mixture into a sieve or colander and leave to drain and cool. Using a saucer as a guide, cut out 24 rounds about 12.5 cm (5 in) in diameter from the filo pastry, cutting 6 rounds from each sheet. Stack the filo rounds in a pile, then cover with cling film to prevent them from drying out. When the spinach mixture is cool, squeeze out as much excess liquid as possible, then transfer to a bowl. Add the tuna, eggs, hot pepper sauce, and salt and pepper to taste. Mix well. Preheat the oven to 200°C (400°F, gas mark 6). Take one filo round and very lightly brush with some of the remaining oil. Top with a second round and brush with a little oil, then place a third round on top and brush with oil. Place a heaped tbsp of the filling in the middle of the round, then fold the pastry over to make a half-moon shape. Fold in the edges, twisting them to seal, and place on a non-stick baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining pastry and filling to make 8 briks in all. Lightly brush the briks with the remaining oil. Bake for 12–15 minutes or until the pastry is crisp and golden brown. Meanwhile, combine the tomatoes and cucumber in a bowl and sprinkle with the lemon juice and seasoning to taste. Serve the briks hot with this salad and the chutney.	https://www.themealdb.com/images/media/meals/2dsltq1560461468.jpg	null	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5n1fN8TGHs	2020-10-27 21:11:28	2020-10-27 21:11:28	Olive Oil	Spring Onions	Spinach	Filo Pastry	Tuna	Eggs	Hotsauce	Tomatoes	Cucumber	Lemon Juice	Apricot Jam										2 tbs	8	200g	4	1 can	2	Dash	4 Chopped	1/4	1 tbs	4 tbs

Mix in a bowl with sugar, fish sauce, thick soy sauce, pepper, and oil until sugar dissolves. Marinate the meat for 1 hour, or overnight for better results. Bake the pork at 375F for 10-15 minutes or until about 80% cooked. Finish cooking by broiling in the oven until a nice golden brown color develops, flipping the pieces midway. Assemble your bowl with veggies, noodles, and garnish. Many like to mix the whole bowl up and pour the fish sauce on top, but I like to make individual bites and sauce it slowly.	https://www.themealdb.com/images/media/meals/qqwypw1504642429.jpg	null	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3qcQcENzbU	2020-10-27 21:11:28	2020-10-27 21:11:28	Pork	Rice Vermicelli	Egg Rolls	Challots	Garlic	Sugar	Fish Sauce	Soy sauce	Pepper	Olive Oil	Cucumber	Mint	Peanuts								1.5 pounds sliced	1 package thin	4-6	3 tablespoons minced	1.5 tablespoons minced garlic	¼ cup	1 tablespoon	½ tablespoon thick	½ tablespoon	3 tablespoons	Sliced	Leaves	Crushed

Add the onions to the pan and cook for 5 mins until softened. Add the garlic and cook for a further 1 min, then stir in the cinnamon and flour and cook for a further min. Return the duck to the pan, add the wine, tomatoes, stock, herbs, sugar and seasoning. Bring to a simmer, then lower the heat, cover with a lid and cook for 2 hrs, stirring every now and then. Carefully lift the duck legs out of the sauce and place on a plate – they will be very tender so try not to lose any of the meat. Pull off and discard the fat, then shred the meat with 2 forks and discard the bones. Add the meat back to the sauce with the milk and simmer, uncovered, for a further 10-15 mins while you cook the pasta. Cook the pasta following pack instructions, then drain, reserving a cup of the pasta water, and add the pasta to the ragu.

252	Vegetable Shepherd’s Pie	Irish	Add Ingredients: 12 cups chopped mixed vegetables 1 cup chopped fresh mushrooms 1 cup pearl onions TOPPING: Preheat oven to 450°. Bake potatoes on a foil-lined baking sheet until tender, about 45 minutes. Let cool slightly, then peel. Press potatoes through a ricer, food mill, or colander into a large bowl. Add butter; stir until well blended. Stir in milk. Season to taste with salt. FILLING: Soak dried porcini in 3 cups hot water; set aside. Combine lentils, 1 garlic clove, 1 tsp. salt, and 4 cups water in a medium saucepan. Bring to a boil; reduce heat and simmer, stirring occasionally, until lentils are tender but not mushy, 15–20 minutes. Drain lentils and discard garlic. Heat 3 Tbsp. oil in a large heavy pot over medium heat. Add onions and cook, stirring occasionally, until soft, about 12 minutes. Add chopped garlic and cook for 1 minute. Stir in tomato paste. Cook, stirring constantly, until tomato paste is caramelized, 2–3 minutes. Add bay leaves and wine; stir, scraping up any browned bits. Stir in porcini, slowly pouring porcini soaking liquid into pan but leaving any sediment behind. Bring to a simmer and cook until liquid is reduced by half, about 10 minutes. Stir in broth and cook, stirring occasionally, until reduced by half, about 45 minutes. Strain mixture into a large saucepan and bring to a boil; discard solids in strainer. Stir cornstarch and 2 Tbsp. water in a small bowl to dissolve. Add cornstarch mixture; simmer until thickened, about 5 minutes. Whisk in miso. Season sauce with salt and pepper. Set aside. Preheat oven to 450°. Toss vegetables and pearl onions with remaining 2 Tbsp. oil, 5 garlic cloves, and rosemary sprigs in a large bowl; season with salt and pepper. Divide between 2 rimmed baking sheets. Roast, stirring once, until tender, 20–25 minutes. Transfer garlic cloves to a small bowl; mash well with a fork and stir into sauce. Discard rosemary. DO AHEAD: Lentils, sauce, and vegetables can be made 1 day ahead. Cover separately; chill. Arrange lentils in an even layer in a 3-qt. baking dish; set dish on a foil-lined rimmed baking sheet. Toss roasted vegetables with fresh mushrooms and chopped herbs; layer on top of lentils. Pour sauce over vegetables. Spoon potato mixture evenly over. Bake until browned and bubbly, about 30 minutes. Let stand for 15 minutes before serving.	https://www.themealdb.com/images/media/meals/w8umt11583268117.jpg	Alcoholic		2020-10-27 21:11:28	2020-10-27 21:11:28	Potatoes	Small Potatoes	Salted Butter	Mushrooms	Brown Lentils	Garlic	Kosher Salt	Onion	Tomato Puree	Bay Leaves	Olive Oil	Dry White Wine	Vegetable Stock	Cornstarch	Soy Sauce	Rosemary	Parsley	Sage	Chives		3 Lbs	3 Lbs	1/2 cup	1 oz	3/4 cup	6 cloves	1 tsp	3 cups	2 tbsp			2 cups	8 cups	2 tbsp	2 tsp	2 sprigs

1	Spicy Arrabiata Penne	Italian	Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add kosher salt to the boiling water, then add the pasta. Cook according to the package instructions, about 9 minutes. In a large skillet over medium-high heat, add the olive oil and heat until the oil starts to shimmer. Add the garlic and cook, stirring, until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the chopped tomatoes, red chile flakes, Italian seasoning and salt and pepper to taste. Bring to a boil and cook for 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and add the chopped basil. Drain the pasta and add it to the sauce. Garnish with Parmigiano-Reggiano flakes and more basil and serve warm.	https://www.themealdb.com/images/media/meals/ustsqw1468250014.jpg	Pasta,Curry	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IszT_guI08	2020-10-25 02:34:59.087165	2020-10-25 02:34:59.087165
